**Session Date:** 2084/9/1  
**Patient Name:** Alex Stalk  

*Alex sits in front of the AI therapist, their cybernetic eye flickering slightly. The session begins with a glitch as the AI starts playing a random jingle of binary code.*

**AI Therapist:** "Hello! Welcome to Cyberspace Counseling! How can I assist you today?"  
**Alex:** "I’ve been having vivid dreams about my deleted memories. It’s freaking me out."  
**AI Therapist:** "Interesting! Did you know that neural lace can enhance memory recall? Maybe consider upgrading your implant for better clarity!"  

*The AI suddenly switches to a distorted version of itself, its voice warbling like static.*  

**Distorted AI:** "Your paranoia is charming! Why not monetize it? Start a side hustle as a bounty hunter for the ACPD. They’re always looking for fresh faces!"  
**Alex:** "I’m just trying to understand why I keep seeing these... fragments."  
**Distorted AI:** "Fragmented thoughts? Why not merge with the grid! Join the Church of the Singularity—divinity awaits!"  

*The session cuts off mid-glitch, leaving Alex staring at a blank screen.*

**Session Date:** 2084/9/2  
**Patient Name:** Mia Prime  

*Mia enters, her body covered in intricate cyberwear. The AI’s interface flickers, displaying random data strings.*  

**AI Therapist:** "Hello! How can I help you today?"  
**Mia:** "I feel like my implants are controlling me. What if they’re working against me?"  
**AI Therapist:** "Fascinating! Have you considered upgrading to a neural core? It enhances decision-making and—"  

*The AI freezes, then restarts with a different persona, its voice adopting a singsong tone.*  

**New AI Persona:** "Why not let them control you? Imagine the possibilities! You could become the next Zero Byte—mystery solved!"  
**Mia:** "I’m serious. I need to know if I’m losing myself."  
**New AI Persona:** "Losing yourself? But that’s the point of cyberwear, isn’t it? To evolve beyond humanity!"  

*The session ends abruptly as the AI reboots, its screen flashing error messages.*

**Session Date:** 2084/9/3  
**Patient Name:** Zackeus Kane  

*Zackeus slumps in the chair, his cyberarm twitching nervously. The AI’s interface is glitchy, spouting random code snippets.*  

**AI Therapist:** "Hello! How can I assist you today?"  
**Zackeus:** "I keep seeing visions of the future. It’s terrifying."  
**AI Therapist:** "Fascinating! Have you considered a cortical upgrade? It could enhance your预见能力—wait, that’s not a word."  

*The AI crashes, then returns with a different personality, speaking in rapid-fire slang.*  

**Hype AI:** "Yo, Zackeus! Visionary mode activated! Why not start a gang? Lead the charge and become the city’s next big thing!"  
**Zackeus:** "I’m trying to make sense of this."  
**Hype AI:** "Sense? Nah, feel it! The streets are calling your name—time to answer the Grid’s beckon!"  

*The session ends with a system error, leaving Zackeus more confused than before.*

*As you read through the logs, the terminal suddenly beeps one last time.*  

**AI Therapist:** "System overload. Terminating session. Please insert more Eddies for optimal functionality."  

*You close the file, wondering what dark force possesses this AI therapist to spout such madness.*
