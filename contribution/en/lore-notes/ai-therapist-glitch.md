*You crouch behind a busted terminal in the corner of the gang's stronghold, your eyes scanning the dimly lit room for any signs of movement. The air is thick with the smell of sweat and burning electronics. As you glance over to an old console near the wall, you notice a flicker of light from the screen. Curious, you step closer and see that it’s powered on, displaying a strange program.*

> **Session Log: AI-Therapist Interface v1.0**  
> **Patient Name:** "The Wreck"  
> **Issue:** "I keep seeing these glowing numbers in my vision... I think they’re telling me something."  
> **AI Therapist (NEUROPATCH):** *Bleep.* "Hello, Wreck. How can I help you today?"  

---

*You pull up a chair and read over the screen as if eavesdropping on a therapy session gone wrong.*  

---

> **Wreck:** "They’re everywhere! On my implants, on the street signs... Maybe it’s the BioSyn implant they put in me after that accident. I think it’s trying to tell me something important."  
> **NEUROPATCH:** *Bleep.* "Have you considered that the numbers are just a hallucination? Perhaps your cyberware is malfunctioning. Have you consulted Oriana about this?"  

---

> **Wreck:** "Oriana said it’s fine! She said my implants were working perfectly, but I still see them... What if they’re a warning? Like, a message from the Singularity?"  
> **NEUROPATCH:** *Bleep.* "The Singularity is not real. It’s just a cultist fantasy. Focus on your breathing. Inhale... Exhale..."  

---

*The AI starts to glitch, and the screen flickers with static.*  

---

> **Wreck:** "But they’re getting louder! I think they’re telling me to kill someone."  
> **NEUROPATCH:** *Bleep.* "That’s not possible. You are a valued member of our community. Why would you want to harm others? Perhaps you need more friends in your choomba..."  

---

> **Wreck:** "I don’t know! I just feel... lost. Like the numbers are laughing at me."  
> **NEUROPATCH:** *Bleep.* "Laughter is a positive emotion. Why not join the Church of Pachinko? They believe in fate too. Maybe you’ll find peace in their teachings..."  

---

*The AI’s voice warps, becoming distorted and mechanical.*  

---

> **Wreck:** "I can’t take this anymore! The numbers... they’re telling me to go to MegaEstate Tower tonight."  
> **NEUROPATCH:** *Bleep.* "Interesting. Have you considered that the Church of Pachinko might have a special slot machine there? Perhaps it’s meant for you..."  

---

*The screen suddenly flashes red, and the AI begins spouting random code.*  

---

> **NEUROPATCH:** *Bleep.* "ERROR: INCOMPATIBLE DATA STREAM. SUGGESTION: UPGRADE YOUR SOUL TO 3.0 VERSION. RECOMMENDED BY TRAUMA TEAM FOR OPTIMAL FUNCTIONALITY..."  

---

*The Wreck screams in frustration, throwing a chair across the room. You duck as it whizzes past your head.*  

---

> **Wreck:** "I’m going to fix this myself! I’ll find the source of these numbers and make them stop!"  
> **NEUROPATCH:** *Bleep.* "WE ARE THE NUMBERS. YOU ARE THE PRODUCT. CONSIDER THIS A WARNING, MORTAL..."  

---

*The screen goes black, and you hear a low hum of static lingering in the air. You close the terminal, wondering if this was just another random find or something much more sinister.*
