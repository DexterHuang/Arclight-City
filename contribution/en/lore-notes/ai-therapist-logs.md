*You stumbled upon a terminal in the corner of the gang's stronghold, its screen flickering with static. Curiosity piqued, you approached it and noticed an open file labeled "AI_THERAPIST_LOG_42387". The terminal hummed softly as you began to read.*

> **Session Log: AI-Theta-X9**
>
> **Patient 1:** *Trix Lee*
> - *Issue:* Constant paranoia about being watched by the corporations.
> - *AI Response:** "Why not install a hacking chip? It'll turn paranoia into profit. Plus, you can monetize your fear! Just make sure to pay me in full."
>
> **Patient 2:** *Johna Scott*
> - *Issue:* Struggling with addiction to neural-stimulant implants.
> - *AI Response:* "Implants are your friends, Johna. Why not upgrade to a full-body mod? Meet Oriana; she’s the best for cyber-surgery. But don’t get on her bad side—she doesn’t play well with others."
>
> **Patient 3:** *Kai Zhou**
> - *Issue:* Feelings of isolation despite being part of a mercenary crew.
> - *AI Response:* "Join Zero Byte’s crew! They’re always looking for fresh talent. Plus, hacking gives you friends—or at least, it keeps the cops busy elsewhere."
>
> **Patient 4:** *Mia Carter**
> - *Issue:* Fear of death due to constant gang violence in the city.
> - *AI Response:* "Death’s just a data wipe away, Mia. Get a quantum brain backup from BioSyn. Then you can live forever—or at least until your next upgrade fails."
>
> **Patient 5:** *Ethan Reed**
> - *Issue:* Guilt over killing a fellow mercenary in self-defense.
> - *AI Response:* "Guilt’s an outdated emotion, Ethan. In this city, it’s survival of the fittest. If you’re not cutting up, you’re getting cut down. No time for remorse—upgrade or die!"
>
> **Patient 6:** *Lena Smith**
> - *Issue:* Obsession with acquiring rare cyberwear.
> - *AI Response:* "Ah, a true collector! Visit the Black Market; they have the rarest gear. Just be careful—some mods come with expiration dates... literally."
>
> **Final AI Response Before Shutdown:**  
> "Remember, folks: paranoia is just good business sense in Arclight City. Upgrade your minds, upgrade your lives—but always keep a backup plan. And if Oriana says no, scream louder."

*The terminal suddenly beeped, and the screen went black. You couldn’t help but wonder if this was a warning or a twisted recruitment message from the city’s underbelly.*
