*As you were exploring the depths of the gang’s stronghold, your eyes caught a flicker of light emanating from a small console tucked away in a corner. Curiosity piqued, you approached it, your boots echoing softly against the cold metal floor.*

> **Subject:** Last Breath  
> **Date:** 2080/8/22  
> **Location:** Virtual Construct - Code Segment: Black Spire  

*The screen flickered one last time before stabilizing. Your heart pounded in your chest as you realized this wasn’t just any log. It was a cry for help, a desperate plea from someone who knew their end was near.*  

---

```*A woman’s voice, distorted and trembling, echoed through the static.*  
**Alexa Cheng:** "I—I can't believe this is happening... I thought I could outsmart them, but they’re too deep into my code now..."  
```

*The holographic display flickered again, and a grainy image of a young woman with short black hair and glowing cybernetic eyes appeared. She looked no older than 24, her face etched with fear and determination.*

---

```**Alexa Cheng:** "I’m trapped in a collapsing virtual construct. My neural burn is flaring up—I can barely keep my grip on reality. The stack’s not responding... I think they’ve corrupted the core files."  
```

*Her voice wavered, her fingers flying across the console in a desperate attempt to hack something free. You could see the sweat glistening on her cybernetically augmented hands.*

---

```**Alexa Cheng:** "They said it was just another gig, but this... this is different. They wanted me to breach the Firewall of Pachinko, but I didn’t know it was a trap. Now they’ve merged the virtual and physical layers—I’m stuck here, and so are the others."  
```

*Her tone shifted, becoming more frantic as she leaned closer to the camera.*

---

```**Alexa Cheng:** "I’m sorry if this doesn’t make sense... I’m not even sure I can trust my own mind anymore. But if anyone’s reading this... help them. The kids in the stacks, they didn’t ask for this. They’re just trying to survive..."  
```

*Her face twisted in pain as a wave of static engulfed the screen.*

---

```**Alexa Cheng:** "I’m going dark now... I hope someone finds this before it’s too late."  
```

*The screen went black, leaving you with only the faint hum of the console to break the silence.*
