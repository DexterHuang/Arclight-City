*You noticed a flickering holographic terminal on the wall, its screen cracked and smudged with grime. Curious, you approached it, expecting some encrypted message or a map of the compound. Instead, you found a log file titled "AR Addiction Support Group." The file was marked as a transcript from a recent meeting.*

> **[AR Addiction Support Group Transcript - Session #123]**

*The hologram flickered to life, revealing a grainy video feed of a dimly lit room. A group of individuals sat around a table, their faces half-obscured by AR overlays and cybernetic enhancements. The moderator, a woman with neon-blue hair and glowing eyes, addressed the group.*

---

**Moderator (Barbi Green):**  
"Welcome back, choomsters. Let’s get started. Who wants to go first today? Anybody feel like sharing their latest AR adventure?"

*The room fell silent for a moment before a man in a tattered trench coat raised his hand. His arm was covered in glowing tattoos that pulsed with data.*

**Patient #47 (Viktor):**  
"Uh... so, last night, I was just chilling at the Vapor Alley District, right? And I’m trying to find my way through this fog, but it’s like, *whoa*, the AR map keeps glitching. One minute it shows me a path, next thing I know, I’m in some weird virtual dojo fighting ninjas. And I’m like, ‘Yo, is this real or not?’

"But then, when I finally get back to my apartment, my roommate’s like, ‘Dude, you’ve been missing for three days.’ Turns out, I’d been looping through the same AR simulation, thinking it was real. Choom, that was a close one."

---

**Barbi Green:**  
"That’s wild, Viktor! Just remember, reality is still out there. And don’t forget to sync your implants daily."

*The group chuckled nervously as another person spoke up.*

---

**Patient #29 (Luna):**  
"Okay, so I’m still new to this AR whole shebang. Last week, I thought I was part of some secret mission because my implants kept buzzing. Turns out, it was just a badly coded AR game called ‘CyberSpy.’ I spent two days trying to ‘hack’ the city’s grid by waving my hands in the air. My job as a sushi chef suffered majorly."

*The room erupted in laughter, but Luna’s expression remained serious.*

---

**Luna:**  
"Hey, it was fun while it lasted. But now I can’t even tell if the fish I’m slicing is real or just an AR projection. Choom, that’s messed up."

---

**Barbi Green:**  
"Sad to hear, Luna, but you’re not alone. Let’s raise our mugs to reality!"

*The group clinked their holographic mugs, a faint *ping* echoing in the air.*

---

**Patient #72 (Niko):**  
"Alright, let’s keep it real for a sec. I’ve been on this AR kick since the implant glitched last month. One day, I’m just scrolling through my feeds, and suddenly, I’m *inside* a virtual world. It was amazing—better than any trip to the Red Bar. But then I realized, I wasn’t talking to Hana anymore; I was talking to an AI projection of her. Choom, that broke my heart."

*Niko paused, his voice cracking slightly.*

---

**Niko:**  
"But hey, at least I can still tell when I’m in AR mode now. It’s like... the world feels a little less real every day, though."

---

*The hologram flickered again, static distorting the画面 before it cut to black. The file ended there, leaving you with the unsettling feeling that reality was just a game for these individuals.*

--- 

*You couldn’t help but wonder how many others were trapped in their own augmented realities, just like them.*
