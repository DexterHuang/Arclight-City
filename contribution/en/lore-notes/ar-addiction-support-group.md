*You found a terminal in a dimly lit room of the gang stronghold, the screen flickering slightly. On it, you discover a log file labeled "AR Addiction Support Group." Curious, you decide to read through it.*

**[Participant 1]: Judy King**  
*Sitting nervously, fingers fidgeting with a cyberdeck.*  
"I started using AR to cope with the loss of my job at MegaEstate. You know, after they fired me for 'not fitting the company culture,' I found solace in these virtual worlds. But now... I can't tell if I'm designing buildings or fighting off holographic debt collectors. My wife says I scream in my sleep about 'overleverage' and 'net losses.' Help me, choomba."

**[Participant 2]: Suki Miller**  
*Smirking, one eye still glowing from an AR overlay.*  
"I used to be a mercenary, you know? But after the Red Bar gig went south, I started relying on combat overlays. Now, when I'm not high on net, I think I'm still fighting. Last week, I tried to take out a whole gang... turns out it was just a bunch of street kids playing a VR war game. They ran away screaming. Classic."

**[Participant 3]: Lee Huang**  
*Twitching fingers, muttering to themselves.*  
"I installed an AR overlay that promised me 'eternal knowledge.' Turns out, it just loops the same tutorial over and over. Now I think I'm a netrunner for TaiXing Cybernetic. My boss says I'm hallucinating, but I swear I heard Elara Voss on the other end of the line. She told me to 'upgrade my neural core or get left behind.'"

---

**[Participant 4]: Marco Chavez**  
*Sighing deeply, looking at his augmented reality glasses.*  
"I used AR to deal with the loss of my legs after a street fight. It kept me sane, let me walk again in virtual worlds. But now... I can't feel real ground beneath my feet. My physical body feels like a distant memory. Sometimes, I even forget how to breathe without the AR telling me to."

---

**[Participant 5]: Zara Patel**  
*Calmly sipping from a chipped mug.*  
"I was just trying to escape the slums with AR fashion. But one day, my implants started glitching. Now I think I'm a character in a game, and everyone else is an NPC. My handler at CircuitBreak says I need to 'disconnect and get back to reality,' but I don't even know what that feels like anymore."

---

**[Facilitator]: Dr. Elara Voss (via hologram)**  
*Flaring up on the screen, looking concerned.*  
"Judy, Suki, Lee, Marco, Zaraâ€”your stories are a testament to our fractured reality. AR is not a cure; it's a double-edged sword. Remember, you are more than your overlays and implants. Seek balance, and seek help."

---

*The screen flickers one last time before going dark.*  
*You wonder if the facilitator was real or just another AR hallucination.*
