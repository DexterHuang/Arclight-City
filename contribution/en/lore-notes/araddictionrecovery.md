*As you were exploring the gang's stronghold, you stumbled upon an old terminal on the wall. Out of curiosity, you decided to check it out.*

> **Augmented Reality Addiction Support Group Log**  
>
> *Facilitator: "Welcome back, everyone. Let’s start today’s session with a quick round of introductions. Share your names and how AR has been impacting your life recently."*
>
> **Graham Williams**: "Yo, I’m Graham. So, I’ve been trying to quit this AR thing for like a week now, but man, the games keep calling my name! I thought I was invincible in* CyberHaven*, but turns out I just got mugged outside the Virtual Store yesterday."  
>
> **Valaria Torres**: "Same here, Valaria. I used to have this AR app that let me see my pets as little chibis. But now they’re these giant monsters chasing me through the streets! And don’t even get me started on the *MegaEstate* bill—I swear they’re part of some corporate conspiracy."  
>
> **Kaito Tanaka**: "Aww, you guys are lucky. I’m still trying to figure out why my AR fashion app keeps telling me I look like a walking anime character. Maybe I should switch to something more... practical."  
>
> *Facilitator: "Great sharing, everyone. Now, let’s talk about one thing we can all do to help each other stay grounded this week..."*
>
> **Graham Williams**: "I got an idea—what if we just... turn off our AR glasses for a day? No games, no chibis, nothing. Just pure, unadulterated reality."  
>
> **Valaria Torres**: "That sounds intense, but I’m in! My cats already gave me enough trauma for a lifetime."  
>
> **Kaito Tanaka**: "I’ll try it too. Although, I might end up looking like a lost tourist without my AR style guide..."  
>
> *Facilitator: "Sounds like a plan. Remember, the support line is always open if reality gets too overwhelming."*
>
> **Graham Williams**: "*Sigh*... I just hope this doesn’t turn out like that time I tried to quit coffee. You know how it ended—"  
>
> **Valaria Torres**: "We’re still here, Graham. We’re still here."

*The terminal flickers slightly before going dark, leaving you wondering if the entire conversation was even real.*
