*You stepped into the dimly lit room, your boots echoing against the cold metal floor. The air was thick with the scent of rust and oil, and the flickering holograms on the walls suggested this place had seen better days. On a nearby table, an old terminal hummed softly, its screen flickering with static. Curious, you approached it and saw a file labeled "FORGOTTEN STORIES."*

*The competition was supposed to be a spectacle—a glutton's gala where the city's best chefs and food connoisseurs gathered to taste the latest in synthetic cuisine. But as I stood there, sipping my neon-blue cocktail, I couldn't help but feel uneasy. The air buzzed with excitement, but it had that familiar edge you get when everyone’s pretending not to notice the elephant in the room.*

*The host, a flamboyant synthoid named Zane, took the stage. His holographic suit shimmered like liquid metal as he announced the grand prize: a lifetime supply of authentic organic food, sourced from the black market at an exorbitant cost. The crowd erupted in cheers, their voices echoing through the massive hall.*

*The first course was served—a synthetic casserole that tasted surprisingly good. It had layers of "cheese" and "meat," both made from lab-grown proteins. But as the courses went on, things started to feel off. The desserts were too sweet, the main courses too rich. Some in the crowd began coughing, their faces turning red.*

*That's when it happened. A young woman at the table next to me screamed as she clutched her throat. Her eyes widened in terror before she collapsed forward, lifeless. Chaos erupted immediately. People started throwing plates and shouting, their voices overlapping in a cacophony of fear and anger.*

*I remember seeing a man pull out a gun—a mercenary, no doubt hired by the organizers for "security." But instead of helping, he joined the fray, shooting wildly into the crowd. The synthetic food had been laced with something real—contraband organic produce, smuggled in from outside the city. It was a revelation that sent shockwaves through the audience.*

*The organizers tried to calm everyone down, but by then it was too late. The place turned into a battlefield. I ducked under the table as bullets flew overhead, hearing the sharp crack of gunfire and the screams of the dying. Some people started eating the fallen bodies, desperate for the nutrients they’d been denied their whole lives.*

*In the end, only a few dozen of us escaped. The organizers were never found—probably dead or fled with their ill-gotten gains. But the memory of that night stays with me, a bitter reminder of how thin the line is between pleasure and chaos.*

*The terminal beeped one last time before going dark. You sat there for a moment, letting the story sink in. The city was a dangerous place, even more so when everyone was starving for something real. You couldn’t help but wonder what other secrets this stronghold held.*
