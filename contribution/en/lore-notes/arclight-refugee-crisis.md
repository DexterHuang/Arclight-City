**Subject:** Overwhelming Influx of Climate Refugees in Arclight City

The situation here is dire. The climate refugee crisis has reached a breaking point, and Arclight City is at the epicenter of this humanitarian disaster. I’ve been on the ground for over a decade, but what’s happening now is unlike anything I’ve seen before.

**1. Influx of Refugees**

Since the start of 2080, we’ve seen an unprecedented wave of climate refugees pouring into Arclight City. Entire communities from drowned coastal cities and scorched rural areas have been forced to flee their homes. The numbers are staggering—over two million people in the last year alone. Many arrive malnourished, dehydrated, and traumatized.

The city’s infrastructure is already strained, but the Mega Corporations refuse to allocate resources for refugee aid. Instead, they’re exploiting the situation for profit. CircuitBreak has been offering "security services" to manage the refugee camps, but their real goal is to push these displaced people out of the elite zones. It’s a lucrative business for them.

**2. Strain on Resources**

The city’s resources are being stretched thin. The Black Market is thriving off this chaos, selling overpriced essentials like water and food rations. The slums are overcrowded, with families cramming into single rooms. Sanitation is nonexistent, and diseases are spreading rapidly.

MegaEstate has capitalized on the desperation by leasing out luxury apartments to refugees at exorbitant prices. Those who can’t afford it end up in the Ghetto, where they’re lucky if they find a place that doesn’t collapse during the next rainstorm.

**3. Growing Social Tensions**

The tensions between locals and refugees are at an all-time high. The ACPD has been enforcing curfews in the Ghetto to "prevent riots," but it’s just another excuse to terrorize the displaced. Meanwhile, the elites in Quantum District couldn’t care less. They’re too busy with their quantum computing projects or genetic engineering experiments to notice the suffering outside their bubble.

The gangs are doing what they can to fill the void left by the government and corporations. Some groups have started organizing relief efforts, but it’s not enough. The Red Bar has become a hub for mercenaries willing to take on gigs in the Ghetto, but even they’re overwhelmed by the sheer scale of the crisis.

**4. Call to Action**

We need immediate intervention. The international community must recognize that Arclight City is ground zero for this climate refugee crisis. Without urgent aid, the city will collapse under the weight of its own inequality and desperation.

The Church of the Singularity is already experimenting with AI-driven solutions, but I’m not sure if that’s the answer we need. For now, it’s up to grassroots organizations like mine to keep fighting for those who have no one else to turn to.
