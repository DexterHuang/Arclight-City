*You crouch behind a pile of crates, your breath steady as you scan the dimly lit room. The air is thick with the scent of rust and oil, and the faint hum of machinery echoes through the walls. You’re in a gang stronghold now, deep in the heart of Arclight City’s slums. The place is a warren of old tech and broken machinery, a relic from a time when this city was still building itself.*

*As you move closer to a terminal on the far wall, something catches your eye—a small monitor flickering with static. You step closer, your hand instinctively reaching for your sidearm as you approach. The screen flares to life, revealing a grainy video feed.*

> **[BEGIN TRANSMISSION]**

*The画面突然清晰起来，一个憔悴的中年女人出现在屏幕上。她的眼睛布满血丝，头发乱糟糟地披散在肩上，看起来像是好几个日夜没有好好休息过。她的声音带着一种令人不安的紧迫感，仿佛每一句话都是从喉咙里挤出来的.*

**Johna Mitchell**: "I know I don’t have much time left... but someone out there needs to hear this."

*Her hands tremble as she adjusts the camera, pointing it towards a document on the table. The paper is covered in smeared ink and coffee stains, and you can see her swallow hard before speaking.*

**Johna Mitchell**: "You’ve probably already figured out who I am—another corporate lackey turned whistleblower. But this time, it’s not just about embezzlement or shady deals. This... this is on a whole other level."

*She pauses, glancing nervously over her shoulder as if expecting someone to burst in at any second.*

**Johna Mitchell**: "MegaEstate has been covering it up for years—experimenting on the poor and desperate, using them as test subjects for their new housing projects. They call it 'urban renewal,' but it’s nothing more than a front for their latest tech: bio-synthetic implants that track every move, monitor your health... and they’re not just stopping there."

*Her voice cracks slightly, and she clears her throat before continuing.*

**Johna Mitchell**: "They’re using these implants to create a new kind of slave labor force. People are being forced into these projects under the guise of 'voluntary participation.' But once you get that implant, you’re not your own person anymore. MegaEstate owns you—they can shut down your organs if you don’t comply."

*She leans in closer to the camera, her eyes darting around as if someone might be watching.*

**Johna Mitchell**: "I’ve seen the files—lists of names, addresses, and dates. They’re planning something big tonight. A demonstration... or maybe a cleanup crew. Either way, they’re going to erase any trace of what they’ve done."

*Her expression softens for a moment, and you can see the faintest hint of a smile before it fades.*

**Johna Mitchell**: "I’m sorry I couldn’t do more. But if you’re watching this, then you’re the one who’s been chosen to expose them. Don’t let me down."

*The screen flickers one last time before going dark.*

*The video ends abruptly, leaving you with a heavy silence. The monitor falls silent, and you’re left staring at the blank screen. You know what you have to do now—you’ll need to find out where this leads, to unmask MegaEstate’s darkest secrets, and stop them before it’s too late.*
