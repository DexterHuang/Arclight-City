*You crouch behind a pile of crates in the dimly lit gang stronghold, your earpiece crackling with static as you try to make sense of the chaos around you. The air is thick with the smell of burning electronics and sweat. Up ahead, a screen flickers to life, showing grainy footage of what appears to be some kind of bizarre competition.*

> **[HARDCORE FEEDBACK]**

*The video cuts in mid-argument. A man with glowing cybernetic eyes is pacing back and forth on a stage, his suit immaculate despite the chaos.*

**Tobe Flores**: "Alright, listen up! This is it—our big break! The Arclight Synthetic Food Tasting Competition, baby!"

*The crowd jeers and cheers, their voices distorted by the poor quality of the camera. You can see a mix of mercenaries, tech enthusiasts, and shady characters in the audience.*

**Tobe Flores**: "And the prize? Unfathomable credits! Enough to get you that new cortical upgrade or that sweet combat suit you’ve been eyeing."

*He gestures dramatically to a table covered in what looks like futuristic food displays. Synthetic meatloafs, glowing pastel-colored candies, and floating soups hover in dishes.*

**Tobe Flores**: "But here’s the twist—this year, we’re going *organic!*"

*The crowd murmurs, some looking uneasy as others exchange glances. A woman with a prosthetic arm raises her hand tentatively.*

**Woman**: "Uh… Tobe, aren’t those restricted? I thought you said they were all synth?"

*Tobe smirks, his eyes flickering with suspicion.*

**Tobe Flores**: "Ah, now that’s the spirit of the competition! You never know what’s on your plate until you bite into it!"

*The screen cuts to a close-up of one contestant taking a hesitant bite. Their face twists in horror as they scream.*

**Contestant 1**: "This tastes… this tastes *real!*"

*Panic erupts as the crowd realizes the truth. Men and women scramble, overturning tables as others dive for cover. The camera pans to a group of mercenaries, their weapons drawn, trying to restore order.*

**Mercenary Lead**: "Hold it down! We’re here to make money, not start a riot!"

*But it’s too late. Someone throws a firebomb, and the room explodes into chaos. Synth food goes flying, and the sound of breaking glass fills the air.*

> **[SYSTEM FAILURE]**

*The screen flickers one last time before going black. A voice crackles over the speakers, distorted and frantic.*

**Unknown Voice**: "…this is a riot… everyone get out while you can…"

*You hear the sound of gunfire and chaos as the transmission cuts off entirely. The room falls silent once more, save for the occasional creak of shifting crates and the faint hum of your own breathing apparatus.*
