*You found a data tablet in a dimly lit room filled with discarded AR glasses and scattered holographic posters of exotic planets. The screen flickers slightly, revealing a log from an Augmented Reality Addiction Support Group meeting.*

**AR Addiction Support Group Log - Session #12**

**Date:** 2081/5/20  
**Location:** "RezLife AR Recovery Clinic"  
**Facilitator:** Kara Voss (Lead AR Dependency Counselor)  

*The session begins with a hushed hum as the group adjusts their VR headsets, the faint sound of digital rain playing in the background.*

---

> **Kara Voss**: Welcome back, choombas. Let’s take a moment to breathe and ground ourselves. Today, we’re going to share our stories—what brought us here, what keeps us here, and how we’re finding the strength to disconnect.

*The room falls silent for a beat before a man in his early 30s raises his hand tentatively.*

> **Xander Perez**: (nervously fidgeting with his AR glasses) So, I guess... I first started using AR combat simulations after my mercenary gig got too rough. You know, the kind where you’re running through alleyways with bullets whizzing past your head. It was like a game, and I could respawn if I died. But then... I couldn’t tell if I was safer in the simulation or out here.

> **Kara Voss**: (nodding) That’s a heavy truth, Xander. How did you find yourself stuck?

> **Xander Perez**: Well, one night, I got jumped by some street thugs. My implants were fried, and I couldn’t even call for backup. But in my AR world... I was this badass mercenary with a full squad behind me. It felt safer, more *real*. Now I can’t stop logging in—I’m starting to think the simulation is the only place where I feel alive.

---

> **Mia Cheng**: (smirking) Oh, Xander, you’re not alone. Let’s talk about my story—my AR addiction started with dating sims. Yeah, you heard me right. After a breakup, I downloaded this virtual romance app where I could be anyone I wanted. Turns out, I couldn’t stop switching identities. One day, I showed up to work at MegaEstate and tried to proposition my boss as my virtual crush. They had to forcibly eject me.

> **Kara Voss**: (chuckling) That’s... vivid. But it’s a common thread—using AR to escape reality.

---

> **Ryder Kane**: (grumbling) I didn’t start with games or romance. My addiction was born from *work*. TaiXing Cybernetic had me testing their new neural implants. They promised it would enhance my combat skills, but instead... I started seeing things that weren’t there. Holograms of enemies, data streams pouring into my eyes. Now, even when I’m offline, my mind replays the simulations like a broken loop.

---

> **Kara Voss**: (softly) It’s可怕的 to see how AR can consume us, but it’s also a testament to our resilience. We’re here because we recognize that the virtual world isn’t the answer—it’s part of the problem.

*The group falls silent again, the weight of their struggles hanging in the air.*

---

> **Mia Cheng**: (sighing) Kara, what if... what if I just keep playing? At least there, I know who I am. Here, in this world, I’m nobody. And that’s terrifying.

> **Kara Voss**: (reaching out) You’re not nobody, Mia. You’re here because you have the strength to admit you need help. That’s the first step.

*The session winds down as the group begins to file out, their AR glasses slipping back on with a faint glow. One by one, they disappear into the digital ether, leaving behind the faint echoes of their stories.*

**End Log**

*As you close the tablet, you realize how fragile the line between reality and illusion truly is in Arclight City. The city’s cybernetic pulse hums in your ears, a reminder that even here, in this clinic, the pull of AR is never far away.*
