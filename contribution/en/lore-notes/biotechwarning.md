*To whoever finds this log,*

I know I shouldn’t be typing this. My hands are shaking as I do so, and every keystroke feels like a gamble. The camera in the lab is always watching—BioSyn’s protocols are tighter than ever since the incident last month. But I have to tell someone before it’s too late.

They’re planning something big, something worse than anything you can imagine. I’ve been part of their team for years, trusted with maintaining their bioware and implants. But lately, they’ve started funding projects that make no sense. Experimental pathogens, genetic engineering on a scale beyond what’s ethical—or legal. 

The latest project code-named *Project New Dawn*—it’s not about curing diseases or advancing medicine. It’s about creating a virus so efficient, so virulent, it could wipe out entire populations in days. And the best part? They’re designing it to be immune to all current vaccines and treatments. No cure, no control.

Why? For profit. Pure, unadulterated greed. They’re planning to release it into the slums first, testing its effectiveness on the “disposable” population. If successful, they’ll sell the antidote at exorbitant prices, making BioSyn untouchable. But what if the virus escapes containment? What if it spreads beyond their control?

I tried to raise the alarm internally. I showed my findings to Dr. Voss herself, but she just laughed. *“Elara doesn’t make mistakes,”* she said with that smug superiority I’ve come to hate. *“This is progress.”*

I’m not so sure. I’m tired of being a pawn in their game. This isn’t science—it’s genocide.

If you’re reading this, please, do something. Stop them before it’s too late. Find someone who can expose this—maybe the Church of Pachinko, or the Singularity faction. They might have resources to shut down BioSyn and bring this to light.

But be warned: I’m not safe here. My logs are encrypted with multiple layers of firewalls, but they’ll track me eventually. If you see this message, know that time is running out—not just for them, but for all of us.

*Good luck.*

*The terminal fell silent again, the cursor blinking endlessly. You felt a cold dread settle in your gut as you realized the gravity of what you’d found.*
