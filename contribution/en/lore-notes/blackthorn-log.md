*You found an old terminal tucked away in a corner of the abandoned lab, its screen flickering faintly. The cursor blinks as if waiting for input, and you can't help but feel the weight of the information it holds.*

> I never imagined I'd be part of something like this. They told us it was for the greater good, a breakthrough in flu vaccination. But as the weeks went by, the samples started acting... odd. The virus we engineered wasn't just mutating; it was evolving.

> "It's not a vaccine," one of the senior researchers whispered to me during a late-night coffee break. "It's a weapon. A way to thin out the herd, if you will."

> I laughed it off at first, but then I saw the memos. Contracts with military contractors. Meetings in secret rooms with suits and too many zeros in their budgets. This wasn't about saving lives—it was about profit.

> The virus they're engineering... it's not just deadly. It's designed to spread faster than anything we've seen before. And here's the kicker: it only affects certain populations based on their genetic markers. The rich, the powerful—they'll have immunity. But for the rest of us? For the穷, the minorities, the "undesirables"? This virus is a death sentence.

> I tried to do something. I leaked some documents, sent anonymous tips to investigative journalists. But nothing changed. They just told me to stay quiet and continue my work. "This is bigger than you," they said.

> Now I'm stuck here, watching the virus take form in petri dishes while the world outside remains oblivious. The thought of what we're creating keeps me awake at night. It's not just a pandemic—it's genocide by design.

> I can't let this go further. Someone needs to stop us before it's too late. But I don't know who to trust anymore. The police? They're in the corporations' pockets. The media? They'd rather sell the story than expose it. And if I go public, they'll erase me. Literally.

> I'm sorry for what comes next. It's not just my job—I'm part of this. But I can't bear the guilt anymore. If you're reading this, find Corabelle Baker. She knows the truth. Tell her what's happening here. Tell everyone.

> Please... don't let me be the one who started the end of the world.

*The terminal falls silent as you step back, the weight of the information heavy in your mind. The note is a desperate cry from someone caught between morality and profit, a reminder that even in a world of cybernetic marvels, humanity's darkest instincts still prevail.*
