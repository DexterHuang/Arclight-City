*As you raided the enemy gang’s stronghold, your eyes caught sight of an old terminal tucked away in a corner. The screen flickered faintly, hinting at data still lingering within its circuits. Curiosity piqued, you approached and booted it up, revealing a hidden message.*

> **Subject:** Final Transmission  
> **Sender:** Caryn Martinez  
> **Date:** 2085/7/19

*The screen flickered, and a distorted video feed began to play. The figure in the recording was frail, her face gaunt with exhaustion. She looked directly into the camera, her eyes wide with both fear and resolve.*

**Caryn Martinez**: "Hello, whoever is watching this... I know you’re out there. I know you see what’s happening."

*She paused, swallowing hard. Her fingers trembled as she adjusted the mic on her headset.*

**Caryn Martinez**: "I’m Caryn Martinez. Former employee of MegaEstate. whistleblower. Traitor. Criminal. They’ve been covering it up for years—corporate greed, exploitation, human rights violations. The atrocities they’re committing... it’s beyond comprehension."

*Her voice shook as she recalled the horrors she’d witnessed. You could almost see the memories flashing behind her eyes.*

**Caryn Martinez**: "They don’t care about the people. They don’t care about the truth. All they care about is profit. But I can’t let them get away with this anymore."

*Her hands flew across the keyboard, typing furiously as holographic data streams flickered in the background. A document materialized on the screen—codified logs of MegaEstate’s darkest dealings.*

**Caryn Martinez**: "This... this is the proof. The evidence I’ve been gathering for months. If you’re seeing this, chances are, I’m already dead. But I want you to know... I didn’t do this out of courage or bravery. I did it because I had to. Because no one else would."

*Her breath came in ragged gasps as she leaned closer to the camera, her eyes pleading.*

**Caryn Martinez**: "If you’re a mercenary, a journalist, anyone with the means to expose this... do it. Expose MegaEstate. Expose the rot that’s poisoning Arclight City. And for the love of whatever gods you pray to—stay alive."

*The screen went black, and the terminal fell silent. You sat there, staring at the empty display, the weight of what you’d just seen settling in.*

*Caryn Martinez’ final message was a cry from the shadows, a desperate plea to those who could make a difference. Whether she succeeded or not, her words lingered—haunting, urgent, and true.*
