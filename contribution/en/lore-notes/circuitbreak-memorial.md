*As you were looting the stronghold, you noticed an old terminal on a blood-streaked wall, its screen flickering faintly. Out of curiosity, you approached it and saw a message.*

> **[ Memorial Note ]**  
> **Subject**: RIP - The Ones We Lost  
> **Date**: 2047/11/9  
> **Location**: Old CircuitBreak HQ Tower  

*The screen fades to static as you open the file, then shifts to reveal a grainy hologram of a woman, her face blurred with tears.*  

**Nan Jones**: "I’m not here to tell you what happened. I’m here because no one else will. My sister Rose... she was just like you and me, trying to make it in this rat hole city. She worked at CircuitBreak, cleaning their offices, mending their wires—just another cog in the machine. But then the attack came. A nuclear fireball that lit up the night like a second sun. They said it was a terror group, but I know better. The government’s hiding the truth. They’re always hiding.*  

*The hologram flickers as Nan’s voice cracks.*  

**Nan Jones**: "I found this terminal in the ruins. It was on CircuitBreak’s database. Decrypting it... they had files. Files of experiments, files of deals, files of lives. Lives like Rose’s. They didn’t just lose a cog; they lost a sister. A daughter. A human being. And now I’m here, typing this out, because maybe someone will hear me. Maybe someone will remember."  

*The screen goes black for a moment, then lights up again with bullet points.*  

> **What to Do**  
> - Stay quiet. The government’s watching.  
> - Keep your head down. The corporations own the streets.  
> - If you see something, say nothing.  

*The hologram fades out, leaving only static and the faint sound of a siren in the distance.*

*As you step back from the terminal, you notice the words "CHOOM" graffiti nearby, a crude memorial to those lost—a reminder that even in this cold, broken city, some still grieve. You wonder if anyone ever found justice for Nan and Rose.*
