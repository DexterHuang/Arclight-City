*As you were exploring the gang stronghold, your boots echoed softly on the cold metal floor. The air was thick with the scent of burnt electronics and sweat. You paused by a flickering terminal, its screen crackling with static. Curiosity piqued, you leaned in closer, noticing a message left behind.*

*You're sitting there, scrolling through your feed, and all you see are those damn hashtags—#TruthMatters, #NoMoreLies. But what do they know? They weren’t here when the sirens wailed. When the sky turned orange. When the streets emptied faster than a glitch in the matrix.*

*My little sister was in CircuitBreak HQ that day. She thought it was just another routine check-up for her cyberwear, something she’d been wanting to get updated since last year’s firmware update. But instead of a new implant, she got caught in the crossfire.*

*I don’t even know how to piece this together. The government says it was a terrorist attack, but what kind of terrorist would use a black-market tactical nuke? And why hasn’t anyone been held accountable? Where are the answers my family deserves?*

*They want us to move on, to forget. But I can’t. My sister’s laugh still echoes in my ears. Her jokes about how she’d one day hack the system and become the next cyberpunk hero. She never made it that far.*

*I left this note here because someone needs to remember. Because the truth isn’t just for hashtags—it’s for justice.*

*The terminal flickered once more before going dark, leaving you with only the faint glow of the screen to guide your way forward.*
