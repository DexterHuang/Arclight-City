*You flicked on your flashlight, casting eerie shadows across the dimly lit room. The air was thick with dust and the faint stench of mildew, suggesting this place had been abandoned for years. Scattered debris littered the floor—broken crates, rusting pipes, and a few shattered cyberdecks. Your eyes caught movement on the wall—a flicker of light reflecting off something metallic.*

*You stepped closer, your boots echoing loudly in the silence. There, half-buried under a pile of junk, was an old terminal. Its screen was cracked but still functional, emitting a faint blue glow. You hesitated for a moment before reaching out to touch it.*

> **Accessing diary file...**

---

*The terminal hummed to life, its screen flickering as it loaded ancient data. The words "PRIVATE DIARY" flashed in red at the top of the blank screen. A prompt appeared: "AUTHENTICATE USER." You hesitated but decided not to interfere, letting the terminal do its thing.*

---

> **Authentication successful...**

*The screen went black for a second before flickering back to life. A distorted video feed began playing, static crackling in the background. The figure on the screen was young, maybe early twenties, with wild hair and deep bags under their eyes. They looked like they hadn’t slept in weeks.*

---

*They spoke in a hoarse whisper, barely audible over the static:*

**"Hey... this is for anyone who might be watching this. My name’s not important, but what I’m about to say is. You know those rumors about what happened at CircuitBreak HQ back in '47? The nuke job? Yeah, that one. They didn’t just bomb the building—they wiped out an entire wing of their HQ. But no one talks about it anymore, right? The government covered it up, said it was a gas leak or some kinda accident. Bullshit.*

**"My family... my whole family... they were there. They were part of the cleanup crew after the attack. I lost them all in one go. My mom, dad, sister—they were gone before I could even say goodbye. And don’t get me started on what happened to my friends. Some of them were lucky enough to just lose their minds from the radiation. Others... well, they didn’t make it out alive.*

**"I know what you’re thinking—why am I telling you this? Because someone needs to remember. The truth doesn’t die just because the government says so. And if you’re reading this, maybe you’ve lost something too. Maybe a friend, a lover, or just someone who mattered. That’s why I’m asking... no, begging you—if you ever find out what really happened that day, tell someone. Don’t let their deaths be in vain."*

---

*The video cut off abruptly, leaving you staring at the static-filled screen. The terminal beeped once more before going dark.*

*You took a step back, your mind racing. This diary was more than just a digital file—it was a scream in the void, a desperate call for justice that had gone unanswered for years. Whoever this person was, they’d been alone in their grief, searching for answers that had slipped away with the dust of old CircuitBreak HQ.*

*As you turned to leave, your eye caught something glinting on the floor—a small, rusted pin. You picked it up, brushing off the dirt. It bore the logo of CircuitBreak, but the colors were faded and worn. A memento of a life lost, maybe? Or just another relic of this city’s dark past.*

*You pocketed the pin and made your way back to the entrance, the weight of what you’d seen settling over you like a shroud. The streets outside were alive with noise—haggling vendors, speeding hovercars, and the occasional bark of a gun. But in that moment, all you could hear was the echo of that whispered plea: "Don’t let their deaths be in vain."*
