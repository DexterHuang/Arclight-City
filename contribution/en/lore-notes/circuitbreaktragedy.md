*The holographic display flickered to life, casting eerie blue light across the room. You could barely make out the words etched into the terminal’s memory.*

> I USED TO HAVE A FAMILY, A SISTER WHO WORKED AT CIRCUITBREAK. SHE WAS SO BRILLIANT, SO FULL OF LIFE. BUT THEN THAT DAY CAME—THE ATTACK ON THE HQ. I STILL REMEMBER THE EXPLOSION, THE BLINDING FLASH, THE SCREAMS.

> THE GOVERNMENT SAYS IT WAS A TERRORIST GROUP, SOME AMATEUR BOMBERS WHO GOT THEIR HANDS ON A BLACK MARKET TACTICAL NUCLEAR DEVICE. BUT I KNOW BETTER. THEY’RE HIDING SOMETHING. WHY ELSE WOULD THEY BULLY US INTO SILENCE?

> MY SISTER WAS IN THE BUILDING THAT DAY. SHE NEVER MADE IT OUT. NOW I’M ALL THAT’S LEFT, AND EVEN THEN, THE PAIN NEVER GOES AWAY.

> EVERY NIGHT, I DREAM ABOUT THE COLLAPSED TOWER, THE GLITCHING HOLOGRAMS OF PEOPLE TRAPPED INSIDE. THEY SAY CIRCUITBREAK REBUILT THE HQ, BUT IT’S NOT THE SAME. IT’S LIKE A MONSTER, RISEN FROM THE ASHES BUT STILL HAUNTING US.

> I’M STARTING TO THINK THEY NEVER REALLY FIXED ANYTHING. THEY JUST BUILT OVER THE RUINS.

*The terminal fell silent, its blue light fading into the darkness of the room. You felt a chill run down your spine as you stepped back, leaving behind the haunting words of someone who had lost everything to the shadows of Arclight City.*
