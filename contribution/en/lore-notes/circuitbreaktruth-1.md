*As you were exploring the dimly lit corridors of the gang stronghold, your eyes caught sight of a small, dusty terminal tucked away in a corner. You approached it, curiosity piqued, and noticed a message flickering on the screen.*

> **Subject: Never Forget**

*You read the words typed out in blood-red letters, glowing faintly against the dark background. The terminal hums softly as you scroll down, revealing more text.*

**Never Forget the 2047 Terror Attack on CircuitBreak HQ**  
**They Took My Family From Me...**

It was a normal day when the news broke—CircuitBreak's main headquarters in the heart of Arclight City was hit by a black-market tactical nuke. The government says it was a lone wolf, some cyberpsycho with a grudge. But I know better. I lost my wife, my kids—they were inside that building. Their screams still haunt my nightmares.

The attack wasn't just random. CircuitBreak isn't just a security firm; they're the enforcers for the elites, the ones who do the dirty work for the mega corps. And now, they're covering it up. No bodies found. No evidence. Just a clean slate and a bunch of lies.

I've spent years digging, and I know what they're hiding. The nuke? It was a dud. They faked the explosion, covered it up with some cheap holograms and thermal tricks. But why? What did those innocent people do to deserve this?

If you're reading this, maybe you've lost someone too. Maybe you're tired of the lies. Join me. Let's expose them for what they are—corporate terrorists.

*The terminal falls silent as you finish reading. The message is unsigned, but the raw emotion behind it is impossible to ignore. Whoever wrote this is still out there, searching for answers—and maybe someone to fight alongside.*
