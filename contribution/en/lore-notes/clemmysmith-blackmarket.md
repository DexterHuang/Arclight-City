*As you were exploring the depths of the gang stronghold, your eyes caught sight of an old terminal flickering on the wall. Curiosity piqued, you approached it, expecting nothing but static or useless data. Instead, you found a message etched into the digital stone—a cry for help from someone lost in the shadows.*

---

> **[Subject: Urgent - Need Assistance]**

*You hesitated for a moment before deciding to read further, unsure of what awaited you. The screen flickered slightly, as if hesitant to reveal its secrets. Then, the words appeared, written in desperate brush strokes:*

---

> **"I'm running out of time... Please, someone help me."**

*Your heart skipped a beat as you realized this wasn't just another piece of data. It was a personal plea, a cry from the depths of despair. The screen flickered again, and a new message appeared, encrypted but with a familiar slang twist:*

---

> **"This isn't my life. I'm Clemmy Smith, a netrunner who got too deep into the game. They said they'd expose my past if I didn't comply. Now I'm stuck between a rock and a hard place—working for The Black Market or becoming a cyberpsycho."**

*The terminal hummed softly, almost like a whisper in the dark. Then, a voice materialized from the speakers—a panicked tone, barely concealed under layers of static:*

**"Clemmy Smith here... I'm being forced to run illegal hacks, set up implants without consent... It's all legal tender now, and I can't stop it. They say if I fail once more, they'll make me a part of the Pachinko Church’s next ritualistic gamble."**

*The screen flickered one last time before displaying a final message:*

---

> **"If you're reading this, I must be dead or worse. But maybe there's hope. Decrypt the file 'Black Ops 7' in my system. It holds the truth about The Shadow’s operations. Please... don't let me be just another ghost in Arclight City."**

*The terminal fell silent, leaving you with a chill that ran down your spine. Clemmy Smith's story was one of desperation and defiance, a reminder that even in the gritty underbelly of Arclight City, hope could still flicker faintly—if only someone were brave enough to answer her call.*

--- 

*As you stood there, the weight of Clemmy’s plea settled over you. Whether you choose to help or ignore it was your own decision—a choice that could change the course of this city's dark undercurrent.*
