*You flipped through a stack of papers scattered across the table, your eyes catching the faint holographic glow of a terminal nearby. The room was dimly lit, with flickering neon lights casting shadows on the walls. Piles of documents, half-empty bottles, and discarded weapons littered the space, giving it the feel of a hastily abandoned operation.*

*The influx of climate refugees into Arclight City has reached a breaking point. Entire neighborhoods are overwhelmed, and the strain on resources is unbearable. The once-thriving downtown district now resembles a ghost town, its streets clogged with displaced individuals seeking refuge from rising sea levels, extreme weather events, and environmental collapse.*

*The numbers are staggering. Tens of thousands of climate refugees pour into Arclight City every week, fleeing countries decimated by droughts, floods, and hurricanes. MegaEstate, the corrupt housing agency, has exploited this crisis for profit, inflating prices and leaving many homeless. The city’s already strained infrastructure is collapsing under the weight of this human tidal wave.*

*Housing shortages are just the tip of the iceberg. Basic necessities like food, water, and healthcare are in short supply. Trauma Team, the elite medical corps, has turned its back on the refugees, leaving them to fend for themselves. The black market has stepped in, offering expensive cybernetic implants and treatments to those who can afford it, while the rest are left to die.*

*Social tensions are simmering. Locals blame the refugees for the surge in crime and competition for jobs. The ACPD, already corrupt and overburdened, turns a blind eye to the violence that erupts between gangs and refugees. The Church of Pachinko has taken advantage of the chaos, recruiting desperate individuals with promises of salvation through gambling.*

*The situation is dire. Without intervention, Arclight City will become a battleground, its streets ruled by desperation and violence. The elite corporations continue to profit while the rest of us struggle to survive. We need action—not just for the refugees, but for the future of this city.*

*You paused, glancing at the terminal’s flickering screen. A holographic message flashed across it:*
