Dr. Voss,

I hope this message finds you well, though I know you're as busy as ever with our "gifted" clients at the MegaEstate. I wanted to reach out about something... serious.

We've done it, haven't we? The "clean slate" project—those goddamn bioware implants designed to manipulate human biology for profit. But this isn't just about enhancing; it's about controlling. They want us to release a strain of the virus in the slums first. A trial run, they call it.

Do you know what they're doing? Testing on the poor, the marginalized—people who don't matter to them. It's not just about eradicating diseases anymore, Dr. It's about power. They're engineering a pandemic for profit, and we're their lab rats.

I've seen the data. The virus mutates faster than we can track. And when it escapes...? No one will be safe. Not even us.

I'm sorry, Elara. I tried to stay silent for the sake of my family, but I can't anymore. If you're reading this, I've already been compromised. They'll come for me soon, but I had to get this out there.

- Auguste

*The terminal beeped softly as if signaling the end of the message. You couldn’t help but feel a chill run down your spine—this was no ordinary log.*
