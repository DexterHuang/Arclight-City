> **Jack Jackson Investigates: Cyberpsycho Rampage in Downtown Arclight**

**Date:** 2085/4/19  
**Location:** Central Business District  

Arclight City is no stranger to chaos, but last night’s events took the city by storm. A lone cyberpsycho unleashed devastation across downtown, leaving a trail of destruction and fear in their wake. Reports suggest the individual, identified only as "Codebreaker," was a former mercenary who had fallen into the grips of madness after extensive neural implants.

The rampage began at the Crossroads Terminal, a bustling hub of mega-corp operations. Eyewitnesses describe Codebreaker as a whirlwind of chaos, tearing through security with ease. Their cybernetic enhancements granted them superhuman strength and reflexes, allowing them to dismantle armed guards and corporate drones in mere seconds. The attack quickly escalated, targeting high-profile buildings like the CircuitBreak headquarters and MegaEstate towers.

**“It was like watching a nightmare unfold,”** said Lisette Turner, a local shopkeeper. **“The streets turned into a battlefield overnight.”**

Amid the carnage, the Arclight City Police Department (ACPD) remained conspicuously absent. Their presence was nowhere to be found, leaving civilians and mercenary crews to fend for themselves. It wasn’t until CircuitBreak’s elite team intervened that Codebreaker was finally neutralized. The security firm, known for its ruthless efficiency, deployed state-of-the-art drones and neural inhibitors to subdue the cyberpsycho.

**“CircuitBreak saved us from an even greater disaster,”** commented Louisa Lewis, a survivor of the attack. **“But it’s a wake-up call. The ACPD is failing us.”**

The aftermath has left the city on edge. Cyberwear enthusiasts are now wary of over-modifying their bodies, and whispers of a new underground movement against excessive corporate power are spreading. For now, Arclight City continues to reel from the trauma, but the scars of last night’s horrors will linger for years to come.
