*As you were exploring the derelict gang stronghold, your boots echoed against the cold metal floor. The air was thick with the stench of burnt electronics and blood. You paused by a flickering terminal, its screen crackling with static before suddenly lighting up.*

*The city never fails to surprise us. Tonight, it showed its ugliest face yet. I was tipped off about some "special shipment" arriving at the Docks District, but what unfolded was beyond anything I could’ve imagined.*

*It started like any other night—dark, damp, and filled with the usual scum crawling the docks. But then, he appeared. Not a he, but an it. A monster. A walking, breathing abomination of cyberwear gone wrong.*

*He moved like a predator, his body a patchwork of glowing implants and clunky exoskeletons. His eyes—pulsating red and blue—blazed with an unholy fury. He tore through the crowd like he was on a mission from the Machine itself. I’ve seen cyberpsychos before, but this one? This one was something else.*

*He didn’t just kill; he *devoured*. Whole gangs dissolved under his rampage. The docks turned into a bloodbath, and the stench of fear was palpable. The ACPD? They were nowhere to be found. Probably too busy bribing corporate heads or chasing down smaller fish.*

*But then CircuitBreak showed up. Not the usual suits in their sleek black uniforms, but their enforcers—the real deal. They didn’t hesitate, opening fire with precision that would make even the most seasoned mercenary jealous. It was a dance of death, bullets flying fast and hot.*

*In the end, it was over as quickly as it began. The cyberpsycho lay still, his implants dimming one by one. The docks were silent once more, save for the occasional wail of a distant siren.*

*But the city’s scars remain. Another victory for CircuitBreak, another tragedy for Arclight City. And another story left untold.*

*The terminal flickered one last time before going dark. You wonder who else is out there—hiding in the shadows, waiting to strike.*
