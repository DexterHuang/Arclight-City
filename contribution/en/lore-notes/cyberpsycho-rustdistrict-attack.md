**[Video starts with static noise]**

**[The screen flickers and stabilizes to show Hana's cheerful face]**  
*Hana: Hey choom! Welcome back to another Sunny Sparkles VLog!*  

**[Her bright pink hair glows as she waves excitedly]*  
*Hana: Today, we’re talking about something super intense—Cyberpsycho attacks in the Rust district! You know, that place where the streets are made of neon and chaos is king. Well, last night, things got even crazier!*  

**[The video cuts to footage of a burning building with people fleeing in the background]**  
*Hana: The attack happened at around midnight. A lone Cyberpsycho went on a rampage through the Rust district, leaving destruction in his wake. He was armed to the teeth—literally and figuratively—with every kind of cyberwear you can imagine. From glowing red implants to a full-body exosuit that looked like it was straight out of a tech nightmare.*  

**[The screen shows close-up shots of the Cyberpsycho, his eyes flickering with distorted data patterns]*  
*Hana: Witnesses described him as a nightmare—part human, part machine. He wasn’t just fighting; he was *tearing* through everything in his path. Security feeds from nearby buildings show him taking down a whole squad of mercs like they were nothing!*  

**[The video shifts to a shaky camera view of the aftermath]*  
*Hana: The ACPD? They didn’t even bother showing up, as usual. But guess who stepped in? None other than CircuitBreak—those elite mercenaries with more style than sense.*  

**[Footage of a sleek black van with "CircuitBreak" logo appears]*  
*Hana: Their team took him down in the end, but not before he caused major damage. Reports say at least 12 casualties and over 20 million Eddies in damages. The cleanup is still ongoing, but the city’s heartbeat is already back to normal.*  

**[The screen shows Hana interviewing a survivor]*  
*Survivor: [Nervously] I was just trying to get home… He looked like he wasn’t even human. It was like he was possessed by some kind of AI or something.*  

**[Hana nods sympathetically, her pink hair bouncing with the movement]**  
*Hana: Cyberpsychosis is a serious issue in Arclight City, and this just proves it. These attacks aren’t just random—they’re a wake-up call. We need to start taking cyberwear regulation more seriously.*  

**[The video ends abruptly as the screen fades to black]*

*You close the file, feeling a mix of awe and unease at the chaos captured in the footage. The Cyberpsycho attack report serves as a stark reminder of the dangers lurking in Arclight City’s shadows.*
