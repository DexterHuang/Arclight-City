*As you were searching the gang's stronghold, you stumbled upon an old terminal tucked away in a corner of the room. The screen flickered faintly, but it was still operational. Out of curiosity, you decided to have a look.*

**CYBERPSYCHO ATTACK REPORT**  
*By: Pammie Collins*  

"Arclight City sure knows how to keep things interesting. Just yesterday, the city was thrown into chaos when a Cyberpsycho went on a rampage in the downtown district. The incident started around midnight, near the Hive City District. Reports say the psycho tore through the streets like a tornado, leaving destruction in their wake."

"From what I gathered, the Cyberpsycho targeted several high-profile locations, including a Trauma Team clinic and a MegaEstate office building. Why? Who knows. Maybe they had a personal vendetta or just wanted to make a statement. Either way, it was pure madness."

"The police were nowhere to be seen—again. The ACPD has been MIA for most of the night, which isn’t surprising given their track record. But here’s the kicker: it wasn’t the cops who stopped the psycho. It was CircuitBreak. Yeah, you heard me right—the same security firm that handles the elites. They sent a team of mercenaries, and boy, did they clean up."

"Word on the street is that the Cyberpsycho was armed to the teeth with some serious cyberware. They had a Synth Arm that could crush concrete and a Brain-Link implant that let them hack into security systems. But even with all that power, they weren’t a match for CircuitBreak’s firepower."

"The attack ended in a bloodbath. The Cyberpsycho was taken down in the middle of the Hive District, but not without taking several Mercenary lives. It’s a grim reminder of how dangerous these Cyberpsychos can be. They’re not just criminals—they’re living weapons."

"Arclight City may be known for its glitz and glamour, but underneath all that neon lies a dark, twisted reality. The streets are a powder keg waiting to explode, and tonight, it gave us a glimpse of what’s coming if we don’t fix this mess."
