*As you stepped into the dimly lit gang stronghold, your boots echoed against the cold metal floor. The air was thick with the scent of sweat and oil, and the faint hum of outdated security systems lingered in the background. You scanned the room, your eyes landing on a crumpled piece of paper tucked under a rusting terminal. Curious, you reached down to grab it.*

*Alright, let me start from the beginning. I’m not a big name, just some schmo trying to make it in this city. But tonight, I saw something that’ll stay with me for the rest of my life. They call it a Cyberpsycho Incident—something you only hear about in whispers or see in the holos as a cautionary tale.*

*It all started at the Red Bar. You know the place—a dive where mercenaries and netrunners rub elbows, trading gigs and stories over tanked-up synth booze. I was just there to unwind after a tough job, but then things got ugly. Some brute walked in—pissed off, spouting about how “the system owes him.” His eyes were all flickered, like he’d been running too many loops on the net. Tattoos crawled across his arms, and his implants were glowing like a neon advertisement for trouble.*

*The bartender tried to shut him down, but that’s when it happened. He snapped. One minute he was angry, the next—he was a monster. I saw him toss a stool like it was nothing, blood splattering the walls. People scattered, but not fast enough. He was on a rampage, mutilating anyone who got in his way. Some poor sap tried to swing a bat, but the Cyberpsycho just grabbed it and snapped it like a twig.*

*I ducked under a table, my heart pounding so hard I thought it’d burst out of my chest. The sound of gunfire echoed—some mercenary must’ve been passing by. But even that didn’t stop him. He laughed, maniacal, as he tore through the place. Blood splattered everything, and I couldn’t look away.*

*By the time ACPD showed up, half the bar was gone. They took him down with a taser-stun net, but not before he burned the place to the ground. I don’t know where he is now—probably rotting in some black site, or maybe they just let him burn. Either way, the city’s lost another soul to the Cyberpsycho curse.*

*After that, I couldn’t stay in Arclight City. Too many memories, too much fear. I heard about HoloHaven District being quieter, a place where nature and tech coexist. But now, even here, I can feel it—like the Cyberpsycho’s shadow still looms over me.*

*If you’re reading this, know that these things happen. One wrong move, one bad trip on the net, and someone becomes a monster. And when they do, there’s no coming back from it.*

*I folded the note carefully, wondering who else might find it. Maybe a mercenary looking for a story to sell to Jack Jackson or Detective Hart. Either way, I tucked it into my pocket and moved on, hoping the next page isn’t as dark.*
