*As you were exploring the gang’s stronghold, you stumbled upon an old terminal tucked away in a dimly lit corner of their base. The screen flickered to life, revealing a message that sent chills down your spine.*

---

> **To whoever finds this,**  
> My name is Daniel Kwan. I used to work for CircuitBreak before the bombing. They told us it was just another day at the office, but we never saw it coming.  

*The terminal screen flickered slightly as you read on.*  

> **Date:** 2047/12/15  
> **Location:** Old CircuitBreak HQ Tower  
> **What Happened:** A black-market tactical thermal nuclear bomb was detonated in the heart of our building. The explosion wasn’t just about destruction—it was a statement. They wanted us to suffer, and we did.  

*The words on the screen seemed to burn into your retinas as you continued reading.*  

> **Who Did It?**  
> No one knows for sure. The government claims it was an accident, a malfunction in their “secure” systems. But I know better. They’re hiding something. CircuitBreak’s files are the key, and they’re locked away somewhere—probably in their old HQ or deep within their servers.  

*Daniel’s message shifted to a more personal tone.*  

> **Why Am I Writing This?**  
> My family… my wife Mei-Ling and our daughter Lisa… they were in the building that day. The government buried them, along with the truth. I want justice for them. If you’re reading this, maybe you can help uncover what really happened.  

*The screen went dark for a moment before lighting up again with one final message.*  

> **WARNING:**  
> The city’s corrupt, and they’ll stop at nothing to keep secrets like this buried. Be careful who you trust.  

*As the terminal fell silent, you couldn’t help but feel a lingering sense of dread. This wasn’t just a memorial—it was a call to arms, a desperate plea from someone who lost everything.*
