*You ducked behind a pile of crates as bullets whizzed past your head, the gang’s stronghold echoing with gunfire and chaos. Scanning the room for anything useful, you spotted a flickering terminal on the far wall. Curiosity piqued, you approached it cautiously, your implant-enhanced eyes catching the glow of a barely functional screen.*

`> The truth is out there, hidden in the code. They’re doing it again... just like last time. But this time, it’s worse. I saw the samples, the modifications—they’ve gone too far. It’s not a cure; it’s a weapon. A virus designed to exploit every weakness in our system. Our own bodies.`

`> BioSyn Industries is behind it. They’re calling it Project "Eclipse." A “pandemic solution” for the masses—code for a bioweapon that’ll take out 90% of the population, leaving only the insured and the elite to rebuild. They’ve already tested it on the slums; I saw the footage. Whole blocks turned into graves overnight.`

`> The labs are working around the clock. They’re pushing the deadline forward—set for next week. If we don’t stop them, this virus will spread like wildfire across the city, then the world. No one will be safe—not even us.`

`> I tried to blow the whistle through正规 channels, but the Church of the Singularity has already cut off all communication lines. They’re buying silence with credits and fear. The Trauma Team is on standby to eliminate anyone who gets in their way.`

`> Listen, whoever finds this—please don’t let me die in vain. Expose them. Stop BioSyn. Save us all before it’s too late...`

*The screen flickered one last time before going dark. You stared at the message, your mind racing. The city was a powder keg, and this was the spark that could ignite it.*
