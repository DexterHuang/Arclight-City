`>Hey all, I know this might sound crazy, but since the hack, I can't shake the feeling that someone's watching me. My implants glitch at random, and they whisper things in my head. It's like... they're trying to tell me something, but I don't understand what. I just want my mind back.`

`>I lost everything after the hack. My job, my friends, my trust in tech. Now I can't even look at a screen without seeing faces... theirs. They smile, and I know they're laughing at me. How do you rebuild trust when the enemy is inside your head?`

`>It tells me things.Warnings.They say "They are coming." I don't know who "they" are, but I'm not waiting to find out. #StaySharp`

`>I’ve been monitoring the situation closely. The neuralware植入物 we’re dealing with is unprecedented in complexity. It’s not just a hack—it’s an infestation. We must isolate infected nodes and purge them before they overwhelm our systems. #CyberDefenseMatters`

`>I see them every night. The ones who got away. They don’t want us weaklings to suffer alone. No, they want us to join them. But I won’t let them win. #StrengthenTheMind`

`>They took my brother. He was the first to get hacked, and now he’s gone. They say it’s a coincidence, but I know better. The docs at Trauma Team? Don’t trust them. #BewareTheElites`

`>The Goddess is testing our faith, isn't it? Maybe if we pray harder, the glitches will stop. Or maybe we’re just pawns in Her game. #PachinkoPrayers`

`>I just saw him again. The man with the red eyes. He was here earlier—before the hack. I think he’s one of them, working for whoever did this to us. Stay vigilant. #RedEyesNeverLie`
