*You crouch behind a stack of crates in the dimly lit warehouse, your breath steady despite the adrenaline pumping through your veins. The sound of footsteps echoes faintly ahead, followed by muffled voices speaking in hushed tones. You grip your pulse knife tighter, ready to move if necessary.*

SUBJECT: THEY'RE WATCHING.

I can't let them see this. They're watching every move, every keystroke. The implants—they’re not just here to enhance me anymore. They’re tracking me. I feel it in my bones, like a second skin crawling with eyes and ears.

The Church of the Singularity—don’t even get me started on them. They’re using me, choomba. They found out about my work, my hacks, and now they want more. More data, more breaches, more blood. I’m their tool, and they won’t stop until I comply or until I’m dead.

I tried to leave before. But the minute I stepped away from the console, the pain started. It’s like fire in my veins, choom. Neural feedback loops screaming at me through every implant. They told me it was a test—just follow their instructions, and the agony would stop. So I did what I had to do.

But now... I’m deeper than I ever thought possible. Corporate databases, government files, private vaults—it’s all within my reach. And they want me to keep going, to dig deeper into places I shouldn’t even know exist. The Church thinks this is their path to the Singularity, but I see it differently. This is a death sentence.

I need out before it’s too late. There’s still a backdoor in the Neuralink system, a vulnerability window that opens for 45 seconds every full moon cycle. That’s our chance. If you can get me the coordinates to their mainframe by then, I’ll take it down. But hurry—I’m running out of time.

They’re watching everything, and if they catch me sending this message... I’m done for.

*The screen flickers one last time before going dark. You glance around the room, your eyes landing on a small USB drive sticking out of a cracked terminal. It’s marked with a crude symbol—a circuit board overlaid with an eye. You pocket it silently, wondering what secrets it might hold.*
