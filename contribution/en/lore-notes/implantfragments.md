*As you sifted through the dimly lit rooms of the gang stronghold, your eyes caught a flicker of light from an old terminal on the wall. Curiosity piqued, you approached it, expecting nothing but dust and obsolete data. Instead, you found a fragmented message—a letter, or what remained of it, typed in hurried bursts.*

> **Subject:** Regretting the Erasure  
> **Date:** 2081/4/30  
> **Location:** Synapse Nexus District  

*The screen flickered to life, revealing a haphazardly typed message. It was a letter, addressed to someone named "Loretta," written by someone who seemed to be grappling with the aftermath of a memory wipe.*

Hey Loretta,

I don't know why I'm writing this... Maybe it's because the fragments are starting to come back. The flashes, the voices—*they won't stop*. I thought getting my memories erased would make things easier. Thought I could start over, leave all that pain behind. But now? Now I’m drowning in half-remembered faces and fleeting images that don’t make sense.

You said it was worth it, that I’d feel lighter, freer. You said the implants would fix me, make me whole again. But this isn't whole. This is just... fragments. *Pieces of a life I thought I buried.*

I remember Oriana’s shop now. The smell of burning circuits and her crazy laughter as she installed my first neurolink. She warned me about the risks, said too much cyberware could turn me into a psycho. But I didn’t listen. Thought I was invincible.

Chloe at the Red Bar—why do I remember her so clearly? Her blue hair glowing under the neon lights, her silence speaking volumes. We used to talk about the past, or what we thought was the past. Now I’m not sure if any of it was real.

And you, Loretta... Why did I ever trust you? Was it because you reminded me of someone else? Someone I’ve forgotten now?

I just want the pain to stop. The fragments are getting louder, more insistent. They’re demanding answers I don’t have. Answers I can’t afford to give.

Maybe I should go back to Synapse Nexus. Maybe they can help. But what if it’s too late? What if the implants have already started to fail?

I’m so scared, Loretta. Scared of what I might remember next. Scared of who I might become if these fragments keep resurfacing.

Please... If you find this, tell someone. Tell anyone. Before it’s too late.

—Weston

*The message cut off mid-sentence, the screen going dark as if the writer had been interrupted. The room fell silent again, leaving you to ponder the fragmented thoughts of a stranger, lost in the labyrinth of their own mind.*
