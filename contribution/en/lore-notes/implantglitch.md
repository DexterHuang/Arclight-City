*You crouch beside the flickering terminal, your gloved fingers brushing over the cold metal surface. The screen crackles to life, casting an eerie blue glow in the dimly lit room. A single icon flashes on the display: "PRIVATE MESSAGE." Curious, you tap it, and a stream of text scrolls into view.*

Hey, listen up, you bunch of corporate sellouts! I just had your "BioGlow Sphincter" implant installed two days ago, and let me tell ya, it's been nothing but trouble. First off, the thing glows in the dark. Like, really bright. I was trying to sneak through a rival gang's territory last night, and this damn ring around my asshole lit me up like a frickin' neon sign. They almost shot me thinking I was some kinda augmented animal!

But that's not even the worst part. The "smart" feature? Pfft, more like "silly putty." It's supposed to adjust my bowel movements on command, right? Yeah, well, it decided to max out the volume setting without any prior notice. During a job, no less! I was in the middle of negotiating with a contact, and BOOM—out comes the noise like a foghorn. Professional moment over. Now they think I'm some kinda malfunctioning cyborg clown.

And don't even get me started on the melody it's been playing. It's stuck on this loop of "Jingle Bells," but in chipmunk pitch. My head is still ringing from that earworm. I tried unplugging it, reprogramming it, even asked Oriana down at the Red Bar to take a look—she said it's not her usual kinda cyber surgery, but she laughed and told me to pay up if I want her to fix it.

I've sent three emails, made four calls, and left ten voicemails on your "24/7 support line." Guess what? Crickets. Not a single reply. What kind of business are you running over there? Some kinda scam operation where they just collect NetCoins and laugh while I rot?

Fix this now, or I'm gonna start leaving bad reviews that'll make Ren's Black Market look like a Sunday school picnic.

*The terminal falls silent as you exit the message. You glance around the room, wondering who left this digital mess behind. It could be one of the mercenaries who frequent the Red Bar, someone desperate enough to buy from BioSyn. Whatever their story, they sure knew how to leave a mark.*
