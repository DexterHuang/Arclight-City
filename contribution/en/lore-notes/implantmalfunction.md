*You approached the terminal cautiously, your eyes scanning the flickering holographic screen. The hum of static filled the air, punctuated by occasional sparks that danced across the surface. You couldn't help but feel a strange mix of curiosity and dread as you reached out to touch the interface.*

> Subject: URGENT - CYBERNETIC IMPLANT MALFUNCTION REPORT
> 
> Dear CyberFlesh Support Team,
> 
> I hope this message finds you well, though given the circumstances, I suspect you might be as frustrated as I am. Let me get straight to the point.
> 
> Approximately 37 hours ago, I upgraded my neural interface with your latest "Smart-Sphincter" implant. At the time of installation, everything seemed to function perfectly—responsive, efficient, and even a bit too eager, if I'm honest. But then came the... complications.
> 
> The issue began during a routine job in the Dregs District. Mid-operation, my implant started acting up. Instead of the usual subtle pressure feedback, I was hit with an overwhelming urge to... let's say "express myself." It wasn't just a minor glitch; it was a full-blown system failure. My body betrayed me at the worst possible moment—right in the middle of a negotiation with a potential client.
> 
> To make matters worse, the implant doesn't just malfunction; it *sings*. A high-pitched, ear-piercing melody that seems to vibrate on a molecular level. Imagine trying to maintain professionalism while your body is essentially performing a symphony of embarrassment. It's like having a built-in kazoo that goes off whenever my stress levels rise.
> 
> I've tried everything in your user manual: recalibrating the settings, resetting the neural link, even attempting a partial shutdown of the implant (which, by the way, is not as simple as it sounds). Nothing has worked. The only thing that's improved? My tolerance for public humiliation.
> 
> Given the nature of my work, I rely on my cybernetic enhancements to remain operational at all times. This malfunction has rendered me unfit for duty—not to mention social interaction. I implore you to address this issue with the urgency it deserves. Lives (and reputations) are on the line.
> 
> Sincerely,
> [REDACTED]

*As you read through the complaint, you couldn't help but chuckle darkly. The combination of cybernetic humor and sheer desperation painted a vivid picture of life in Arclight City. Whatever this person's situation was, they weren't going to get much sympathy from CyberFlesh Support—not unless they had credits to spare.*
