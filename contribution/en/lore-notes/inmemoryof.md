*You find yourself in a dimly lit room, filled with old files and weapons. On a worn desk sits a crumpled piece of paper, its edges yellowed with age. You reach out and pick it up, noticing the faint scent of smoke and oil clinging to it.*

*Dearest Strangers,*  

I write this not just for them, but for anyone who has lost someone to the shadows we call "justice." They were my world—my family. And they were taken from me by the same hands that claim to protect us.  

The attack on CircuitBreak HQ was no accident. It was a lie. A cover-up. The government knows what happened, and they’re hiding it. They buried the truth under tons of rubble and silence. But I won’t let them forget.  

I’ve seen the files, choom. Black-market weapons, tactical nukes peddled like used gear on the black market. Who do you think funded those psychos? Who gave them the tools to destroy innocent lives? The same corporations that laugh all the way to the bank while we mourn.  

They took my family, but they won’t take my voice. If you’re reading this, join me. Find the truth. Expose them. For Emilio, August, and Matias. For all of us who are left behind.  

*Peace,*
