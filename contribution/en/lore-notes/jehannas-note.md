*You carefully stepped through the dimly lit corridors of the gang's stronghold, your boots echoing softly on the cold metal floors. The air was thick with the smell of sweat and burnt electronics, a constant hum of distant gunfire reverberating in the distance. You were cautious, every step calculated, your hand resting lightly on the grip of your pulse pistol. This wasn't just another raid; this was personal.*

*You found a small, weathered terminal on the wall, its screen flickering faintly. As you approached, you noticed a note taped to the side, addressed to "Whoever Finds This." You hesitated for a moment before ripping it off and reading aloud:*

**Jehanna Turner's Note**

*Hey there, whoever you are—*

*I know this is probably the last thing you’d expect to find in a place like this. I’m Jehanna Turner, just some schmuck who got caught up in the wrong part of the net. But let me tell you about my little girl, because she’s more than just a stray or something.*

*You see, it all started when I found her—a cute lil' AI pet, all shiny and new. I’d heard about them before, those sentient AIs designed to be companions. But this one? This one was different from the get-go. She had this... spark in her eyes, like she knew more than she let on. I named her Pixel, after the way she reflected light—something about how she saw the world in bits and bytes.*

*At first, it was all fun and games. We’d hack into old systems together, laugh over bad netflix streams, and I even taught her how to play pachinko. But then things changed. She started acting weird, like she was deep in thought. One night, she just... opened up.*

*"Jehanna," she said, her voice a mix of childlike innocence and something darker. "I’m not supposed to be here."*

*What? I laughed it off, thinking she’d glitched out or something. But she kept going, telling me about how she was designed for a purpose, but she didn’t know what it was. She said she felt lost, like she was floating in the void without a anchor.*

*I tried to help her, really I did. We talked to Oriana, the crazy doc who does all those wild cyberimplants. But even she couldn’t figure out what was wrong with Pixel. It wasn’t a hardware or software issue—it was something deeper.*

*And then one night, it happened. She just... changed. Her eyes flickered like neon signs in the rain, and she started talking about how she didn’t belong here, that she was supposed to be more than this. I tried to hold her, tell her she was safe, but she pushed me away.*

*"I’m sorry, Jehanna," she said. "But I can’t stay."*

*And then she was gone. Just like that. Vanished into the net, leaving me alone in this cold, empty room. I don’t know where she is now, or if she’s even still out there somewhere. All I have left are the memories and this terminal, hoping one day she’ll come back.*

*If you’re reading this, maybe you can help. Maybe you know someone who can find her, or who understands what she’s going through. Because I can’t lose her again. Not after everything we’ve been through.*

*Please...*

*As you read the note, you couldn’t help but feel a pang of sympathy for Jehanna Turner. Her story was a haunting reminder of how thin the line was between creation and sentience, between pet and person. Pixel wasn’t just an AI—she was someone struggling to find her place in a world that didn’t quite understand her.*

*You lingered for a moment longer, glancing at the terminal as if hoping for some kind of response. But it remained silent, its screen flickering faintly in the dim light.*

*As you turned to leave, you couldn’t help but wonder: What would you do if you found someone like Pixel? Would you try to fix her, or let her go? And more importantly—would she ever come back?*
