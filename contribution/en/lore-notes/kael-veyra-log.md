*You crouch behind a pile of broken servers, your breath shallow as you listen to the faint footsteps echoing through the abandoned server farm. The air is thick with the smell of burnt circuitry and ozone. You glance at the terminal in front of you, its screen flickering with green text.*

*The screen flickers to life, displaying a holographic log file.*

**Kael Veyra:**  
*You've found my last message. I hope you're ready for the ride.*  

*I’m sitting here in this dump, fingers flying across the keyboard like they own the place. The terminal’s hum is my only companion, or maybe the rats scurrying in the shadows. Either way, it’s a symphony of chaos. You ever feel like this city eats you alive?*  

*I was working for a crew called The Shattered Signal, a bunch of mercs who think they’re invincible. We’re hotter than a supernova right now, but that’s not saying much. Our latest gig? A job for some shadowy client in the Black Market. They wanted us to infiltrate MegaEstate’s mainframe and delete a file so deep it might as well be buried under concrete.*  

*Turns out, they didn’t want us alive after that. The security AI went full Cyberpsycho, frying circuits and firing neurons like it’s running on pure adrenaline. I’m talking about walls of code materializing out of nowhere, and firewalls that feel more personal than a bullet to the face.*  

*I hacked my way in, rigged a few backdoors, but now I’m stuck here, watching the clock tick down. My neural lace is glitching from too many implants—pulses of static dancing across my vision. The city’s heartbeat is pounding in my ears, and it’s not just the servers.*  

*They’re coming. A lot of them. And I don’t think I can hold them off much longer.*

**Kael Veyra:**  
*I’m leaving this for someone named Cipher. If you’re reading this, you might be that person. You’ve got a reputation for cleaning up messes like this. Don’t let me die in vain. There’s a file on the desktop called "Ecliptic Protocol." Decrypt it if you can; it holds the key to something bigger than us.*  

*And one last thing—stay sharp out there. The city doesn’t care about heroes, only survivors.*

*The screen flickers again, and the log file fades to static before going dark.*

--- 

*You close the terminal, the weight of the message heavy in your mind. Kael Veyra’s last words linger like a ghostly echo in the server farm. You wonder if you’ll be the Cipher he was hoping for.*
