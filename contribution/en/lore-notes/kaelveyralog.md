*As you were exploring the gang's stronghold, you stumbled upon an old terminal tucked away in a corner of the derelict building. The screen flickered faintly, and out of curiosity, you decided to power it on.*

*The terminal's screen flickered, casting a dim blue light on the walls around you. The words on the screen seemed to glow as if they were alive, pulling you deeper into the story.*

**"It all started with a simple job. I was just another mercenary looking for a crew when I got approached by a fixer named 'The Whispperer.' She always had a way of talking you into jobs that sounded too good to be true. This one? It promised a fat payout—50,000 Eddies—for some corporate espionage work. Easy money, right?"**

**"CircuitBreak was the target. I thought it was just another security firm, but they're worse than any gang. They’re a hitman organization in disguise, cleaning up the competition for the elites. The job? Steal their encrypted data and plant a backdoor into their system."**

**"The plan was straightforward: infiltrate their main server room, hack in, and make it look like an accident. But nothing ever goes as planned in this city. I got to the location—a high-security building downtown. Guards patrolled every floor, and their AI sentry drones made me feel like a sitting duck."**

**"I managed to slip past them, using a neural interface to hack into their system. The data was there, but it wasn’t just about corporate secrets. I found files detailing illegal operations—hit contracts, black-market deals, you name it. But as I started exfiltrating, the alarms blared. Someone had raised the alert."**

**"I didn’t stick around to find out who. I high-tailed it out of there, but not before planting a virus that would take them offline for weeks. It was risky, but I wasn’t about to get caught."**

---

**"The real trouble started when the job got traced back to me. CircuitBreak isn’t known for mercy. They sent their enforcers—mercenary crews like The Iron Hand and The Bloodhounds. But it wasn’t just them. I didn’t realize until later that I’d accidentally triggered a city-wide hack while planting that virus."**

**"The system I infiltrated was connected to BioSyn Industries’ medical database. I had no idea they were using it to track their patients—ordinary folk who had no clue they were being monitored. The virus spread, and before long, half the city’s medical records were exposed. People started rioting in the streets, demanding answers."**

**"I tried to clean up the mess, but it was too late. I stayed low for a while, hopping from safe house to safe house, but the heat never died down. The ACPD were on my tail, and so were the gangs who thought I had info on their operations. It didn’t help that I owed some serious debts to the Black Market for the gear I used."**

---

**"Now, every time I look at my cyberwear—my neural interface, my combat exoskeleton—I feel sick. They’re not just tools; they’re reminders of what I’ve become. A hired gun who can’t even do right by themselves. I tried to make things right, but the damage was done."**

**"The last thing I saw before they took me was a headline: 'CircuitBreak Employee Missing, City in Chaos.' It didn’t matter that it wasn’t my fault. In this city, you’re guilty until proven otherwise. And even then, the proof might not save you."**

*The terminal fell silent, and the screen went black. You could almost imagine hearing a sigh coming from somewhere in the shadows of the abandoned building.*

*As you stepped back from the terminal, you couldn’t help but wonder: what would you do if you were in Kael’s shoes? Would you risk it all for a payday, or would you walk away and try to make things right?*

*The weight of the city’s darkness seemed heavier now.*
