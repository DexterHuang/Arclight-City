*You found an old datapad on a table, its screen flickering with static. Curiosity piqued, you decided to check out what’s inside.*

> **To Whom It May Concern,**  
> If you’re reading this, I’m already gone—or at least, I’m as good as dead. My name is Kael Veyra, and for the past decade, I’ve been a prizefighter, a gladiator in the underground circuits of Arclight City. I fought for credits, for glory, for the scraps that kept me alive one more day. But tonight, I’m writing to tell you I’m done.  

> This isn’t about being brave or noble. It’s about being broken. My body is a patchwork of scars and augments—my left eye replaced with a vid lens, my right arm a prosthetic that hums like a dying engine, and a hundred other tweaks that keep me moving just a little longer than I should. But it’s not the physical toll that’s wearing me down; it’s the weight of what I’ve become.  

> I used to think I was invincible, a machine made of muscle and chrome. But every fight chips away at you, not just your flesh but your soul. You start to feel like less of a person and more of a tool, a cog in someone else’s profit machine. The Black Market surgeons who patched me back together after my last near-death experience? They didn’t care about my humanity—they just saw another customer.  

> I’ve seen the best of this life— the thrill of victory, the adoration of the crowd, the rush of endorphins that come with staring death in the face and blinking first. But now, all I see is the cost. The fear of losing everything I’ve built. The knowledge that one wrong move could leave me as scrap metal on some mercenary’s holoboard.  

> I’m not asking for pity or understanding. Just respect. If you ever cross paths with a prizefighter, look them in the eye and see the man—or woman—behind the chrome. Because behind every augmentation is a story of loss, and behind every victory is a whisper of defeat.  

> Kael Veyra is retiring. I’m walking away from the ring, from the blood and the sweat and the endless cycle of violence. Whether you cheer or jeer, I don’t care. What matters now is that I’m alive enough to make this choice—to step back before I become what I hate most: a Cyberpsycho.  

> If you ever find yourself in the PharmaDome District, seeking a new body or a fresh start, remember this: humanity isn’t something you trade away for credits. It’s something you hold onto until your last breath.  

> So long, Chooms. Stay sharp out there.  

> —Kael Veyra
