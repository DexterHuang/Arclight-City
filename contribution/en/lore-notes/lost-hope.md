*You notice a old terminal on the wall, and decide to have a look.*

---
*The terminal boots up slowly, and suddenly a familiar face appears on the screen.*

**Luka Stewart**: "Oh no, please don't let this be another nightmare..."

---
*He takes a deep breath before continuing.*

**Luka Stewart**: "My name is Luka Stewart, and today marks the day that everything changed. It started with a simple job, just stealing data from a rival gang's hideout. But little did I know, it would lead me down a path of no return."

---
*His voice cracks as he continues.*

**Luka Stewart**: "They caught us red-handed. There was nothing we could do but fight our way out. We managed to escape, but not without casualties. My best friend, Xavier, didn't make it. He sacrificed himself so that we could live."

---
*Tears start rolling down his cheeks as he remembers the tragic event.*

**Luka Stewart**: "Since then, I've been living in constant fear. Every corner I turn, every shadow I see, I wonder if they're coming after me next. I never thought I'd end up like this... alone and terrified."

---
*With a shuddering breath, he signs off the recording.*

**Luka Stewart**: "If anyone finds this, please tell my family I love them. And maybe... just maybe, someone can help me find peace."
