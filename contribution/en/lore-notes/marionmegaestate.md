*You crouch behind a stack of crates in the dimly lit warehouse, your eyes scanning the room for any signs of movement. The air is thick with the smell of rust and oil, and the faint hum of machinery echoes through the walls. You notice a flickering terminal on the far side of the room, its screen glowing faintly with data streams. Curiosity piqued, you slip closer to investigate.*

*The screen flickers, and a holographic projection pops up, casting a eerie light over the room. It’s a grainy video feed, static-heavy but clear enough to make out the figure of a young woman in a dimly lit office. She looks tense, her fingers flying across a keyboard as she types furiously.*

**[BEGIN LOG ENTRY]**

*The woman stops typing and turns toward the camera, her face a mixture of fear and determination. Her hair is disheveled, and there’s a dark circle under her eye, but her eyes still gleam with resolve.*

**Marion Thompson:** "Alright, I’ve been waiting to say this for far too long. If you’re watching this, chances are I’m already dead or worse—locked away in some black site courtesy of the people I’m about to expose."

*She pauses, glancing over her shoulder as if someone might be listening.*

**Marion Thompson:** "You’ve probably heard the rumors about MegaEstate—how they’re just another greedy corporation ripping everyone off. But what you don’t know is the real truth. They’re not just stealing your money; they’re trafficking people. Entire families are being shipped out of the city, their homes demolished overnight, and they’re sold to the highest bidder in the black market."

*Her voice shakes slightly, but she steadies herself.*

**Marion Thompson:** "I’ve seen the lists. I’ve seen the names. They’re not just numbers to them—they’re people. Children, mothers, fathers. They’re being forced into labor camps, sold to BioSyn Industries for their experiments, or worse—disposed of like yesterday’s trash."

*She leans closer to the camera, her voice dropping to a whisper.*

**Marion Thompson:** "I know the risks. I’ve heard the stories. But someone has to do this. Someone has to scream into the void and hope it gets heard. I can’t keep running. I can’t keep hiding. If I go down, I want you to know the truth."

*The screen flickers violently, and for a moment, the feed cuts out before returning, showing Marion looking more frantic.*

**Marion Thompson:** "They’re coming. I have to go. But remember this—if you see anyone from MegaEstate acting suspicious, if you hear whispers of trafficking or experimentation, don’t trust them. And whatever you do, stay away from their 'development' centers."

*She hesitates, her breath shallow and rapid.*

**Marion Thompson:** "This is my last message. I hope someone out there hears this. For the people they’ve lost… for the future…"

*The video cuts to static as a loud crash echoes through the room. The terminal goes dark, leaving only the faint hum of machinery to fill the silence.*

*You sit in stunned silence, the weight of what you’ve just seen pressing down on you. Marion Thompson’s words hang in the air like a warning, a grim reminder of the darkness that lurks behind the neon lights and endless skyscrapers of Arclight City.*
