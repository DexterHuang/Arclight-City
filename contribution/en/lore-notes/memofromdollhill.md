> To my lost ones,  
> I write this not just to remember, but to ensure the world never forgets. Today marks the third year since the attack on CircuitBreak HQ, an event that shattered lives and left families like ours in ruins. They told us it was a gas leak, a tragic accident. But we all know the truth—they’re covering it up.  

> My parents, Max Roberts and Elita Clark, were among the victims. They were just ordinary people chasing their Arclight-dream, trying to make a better life for our family. But they never made it home that day. The government buried the evidence, silenced the witnesses, and turned CircuitBreak’s HQ into a tomb.  

> I’ve spent every night since wondering why. Why did they target innocent lives? What dark secret were they hiding? And most of all, why are we left in the dark?  

> This memorial is not just for them—it’s for everyone who lost someone that day. We deserve answers, and until we get them, their memory will live on in my heart.  

> Rest in peace, *Choom*. I’ll never stop searching for the truth.  

> —Doll Hill

*The note ends with a chilling thought: "Some secrets are too dangerous to keep buried." As you set the datapad down, you can’t help but wonder what dark truths lie hidden beneath Arclight City’s neon glow.*
