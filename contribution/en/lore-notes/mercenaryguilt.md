**Log Entry: 2085/9/12**

*Hey there,*

I never thought I’d be writing this. Not after what happened. But here we are.

We were hired by some shadowy client to pull off a corporate job—steal data from MegaEstate’s mainframe. Easy money, right? But as it turns out, nothing in Arclight City is ever that simple.

The job was supposed to be clean: slip into their downtown office, crack their firewall, and grab the files before anyone noticed. But we didn’t account for the civilians. The guards were relentless, and in the chaos, someone must’ve tripped an alarm. Before long, the place was swarming with ACPD goons.

I remember the screams. The innocent faces of the people caught in the crossfire. I told myself it was just part of the job, but now...? It’s been three days since we bailed out of there, and I can’t shake the guilt.

Our crew, The Ghosts, were supposed to be the best. But we’re mercenaries, aren’t we? We do what we’re paid to do. Just business. But seeing those faces... hearing their pleas...

I don’t know why I’m writing this. Maybe it’s a catharsis. Or maybe I just want someone—anyone—to know the truth.

**- Gerrie Martinez**

*The log ends there, leaving you with a sense of unease. The writer’s moral conflict is palpable, and their name suggests they are part of the larger mercenary community in Arclight City.*
