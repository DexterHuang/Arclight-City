*As you were exploring the depths of the gang stronghold, your boots echoed softly against the cold metal floor. The air was thick with the stench of sweat and burnt electronics, a reminder of the recent clashes that had occurred here. You paused near a flickering terminal, its screen cracked but still functional. Curiosity piqued, you decided to take a closer look.*

> Alright, I'm sitting here, fingers trembling as I type. The screen feels like it's burning my eyes, but I can't stop. They told me to document everything, every move, every thought. If I don't comply... well, let's just say the last mercenary who disobeyed is now a smear on the wall.
>
> They found me through The Black Market. I was just looking for some rareware to boost my deck when this guy approached me at the Red Bar. He said he knew someone who could get me the best stuff—if I did a little "favor" for them first. It sounded too good to pass up, but now I'm stuck in this nightmare.
>
> The jobs are bad enough. Hacking into corporate mainframes while they watch you through every pixel of your screen is one thing, but this... this is personal. They're making me target innocent people, civilians, just because they can. And the worst part? I can't even run anymore. My deck's been tampered with—some kind of backdoor they installed. If I try to escape, they'll know, and trust me, they’re not nice about it.
>
> I need help, but I don’t know who to trust. The ACPD’s corrupt, the corporations are worse, and the gangs... well, let's just say they’d rather see me dead than alive. I heard whispers about The Whispperer at the Red Bar—says she can fix anything. Maybe that's my only hope.
>
> But time's running out. My fingers are getting heavier with each keystroke, and the screen’s flicker is getting worse. They’re watching. I have to go before they notice something’s wrong.
>
> Please... if you're reading this, find me at the Red Bar. Tell her NeonBlade sent you.

*The terminal fell silent, its screen dimming as you stepped back, a chill running down your spine. The message left no room for doubt—this wasn’t just another gig. It was a cry for salvation from someone who had hit rock bottom in Arclight City’s endless cycle of greed and violence.*
