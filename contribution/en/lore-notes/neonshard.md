*You found a crumpled piece of paper tucked inside an old datapad. The screen flickers faintly, casting eerie shadows on the walls.*

> To whoever finds this,

I hope you're having a better day than I am right now. My name is Allys Hill, and if you're reading this, it means my last confession has reached someone—probably not the afterlife, but hey, better late than never.

I didn't always hate my memories. Back in the day, I thought they were my greatest asset. I had a past so dark, it could rival the neon glow of Arclight City's skyline. Contracts, deals, and secrets—I was the queen of the underworld, or at least that's what I told myself. But then the headaches started. The visions, the whispers... It wasn't me anymore; it was them—those fragmented memories trying to escape.

I went to Oriana, the RipperDoc everyone whispers about. She promised a clean slate, a fresh start. "Just let go," she said, her eyes glinting with the same greed as the corporations that line our streets. I didn't think twice. Why would I? Memories are just data, right? They can be overwritten like old software.

But here's the catch: not all data is meant to stay deleted. The fragments are coming back—faces, names, places I swore I'd forgotten. And with them, the fear. The fear that someone, somewhere, knows exactly where to find me. That my new memories are just a facade, and the real me is rotting in some digital landfill.

I tried to go clean, choomba. Honest work at a diner, a quiet life. But the streets have a way of remembering. They don't forget, and neither do the fragments. They scream at me through the neon rain, demanding I face what I ran from. And I can't ignore them anymore. Not when they're telling me things I wish I could forget.

If you're reading this, maybe you can help. Maybe there's someone out there who understands the itch of lost memories. Or maybe just know that some slate is too stained to erase. Either way, I'm sorry for whatever trouble finding this letter brings your way.

- Allys Hill

P.S. If you see Oriana, tell her she owes me a refund.

*The datapad falls silent, leaving you with the weight of Allys' regret and the lingering fear that some memories are better left forgotten.*
