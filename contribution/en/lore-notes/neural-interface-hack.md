*You crouch behind a stack of crates in the dimly lit gang stronghold, your eyes scanning the room for any signs of movement. The air is thick with the scent of sweat and burning electronics. On the far wall, you notice a flickering terminal screen glowing faintly in the dark.*

> *"I can't trust anything anymore... I thought my implants would make me safer, but now they're talking to me. Whispering. They say things like 'trust us' or 'we're here to help.' But it's not them, is it? It's them. The ones who did this to me. The corporations. They installed backdoors, didn't they? I know they did. My head hurts all the time, and I swear I heard a voice tell me to 'Disconnect' when I tried to log into my bank account. What if they can see me right now? What if this terminal is listening?"*

> *"I’m starting to think it’s not just the corporations, P.Jackson. The Church of the Singularity might be involved too. I found traces of their propaganda in my植入 after the hack. They’re pushing for the singularity, but what does that mean for us? We’re just beta testers in their fucked-up experiment. If you ever feel like someone’s watching, they probably are. Stay off the grid if you can. And whatever you do, don’t update your firmware unless you want to become a walking data server."*

> *"I owe you one, Kael-47. My implants went haywire last night, and I thought I was going crazy. But hearing it from someone else... It’s comforting in the worst way. What if we’re all just pawns in some bigger game? And what about Oriana? Do you think she knows something? She’s always been a bit too good with tech, don’t you think?"*

> *Posted by: Kael-47*  
> *"Oriana’s legit, but even the best can get played. Remember the Black Market incident last year? They were compromised for weeks. If I were you, I’d start stockpiling Eddies and keep a low profile. And whatever you do, don’t let them find your neural key. That’s the real prize."*

> *"I’ll be careful. But what if...what if this is bigger than us? What if the Church of Pachinko is involved somehow? I keep seeing those slot machines in my vision, you know? Blinking red and laughing at me."*

> *Posted by: Kael-47*  
> *"Don’t go there. The Pachinko Cult’s lost their minds. Stay focused on the real threat. And if you ever need help, hit me up. But remember—trust no one."*

*The terminal screen flickers one last time before going dark. You stand up, your heart pounding in your chest. The thread feels like it was written just for you, a warning from someone who knows what it’s like to be trapped in this digital nightmare. You glance around the room, wondering if there are cameras watching you right now, or if your implants are broadcasting your location to some hidden network.*
