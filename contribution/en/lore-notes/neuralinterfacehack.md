*As you were navigating through the dimly lit corridors of the gang stronghold, your foot caught on a loose cable. You looked down and noticed a small terminal with a flickering screen. Out of curiosity, you decided to check it out.*

> ```You think this is just about paranoia? Think again. They’re in your head. I’m not kidding, they’re inside your skull, feeding on your thoughts like a damn parasite. My implants stopped working after the hack—now they’re just dead weight. Help me...```  

> **[Response 1]**  
> ```*Name redacted for safety.*  
> Same here, brother. They’re using some kind of backdoor code. I tried patching my neural lace but it’s like they’re already one step ahead. Don’t trust anything anymore.```  

> **[Response 2]**  
> *Message from Zero Byte*  
> ```We are all pawns in their game, aren’t we? The neural interface is just the beginning. They want us to rely on their systems, but trust is a luxury they cannot afford us. Stay vigilant and encrypt your thoughts—use burner implants if you can.*  

> **[Response 3]**  
> *Message from Oriana*  
> ```You’re not alone in this. The Red Bar is still safe for now—if you need help with implant removal, hit me up. But don’t come crawling to me unless it’s an actual emergency.```  

> **[Response 4]**  
> ```I lost my partner yesterday. They said they were just running a routine check... but I saw the code. It wasn’t for patching—it was for erasing. I can’t sleep without my visor anymore; every ping feels like a threat.```  

> **[August Lewis replies]**  
> ```Thank you all for listening. I’m still alive, barely, and that’s all I can say for now. If anyone finds anything useful, post it here. Together... we might have a chance to fight back.```

*The terminal screen flickered one last time before going dark. You stepped back, your mind racing with the implications of what you’d just read. The city was getting darker by the minute, and the hum of distant neon lights seemed almost like a warning.*
