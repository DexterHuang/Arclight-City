*You stumble upon an old terminal in a dusty corner of the gang's stronghold, its screen flickering faintly. Intrigued, you decide to hack in and find a strange transcript from what seems like an AI therapist session.*

---

**Therapist:** *Static crackles before a distorted voice takes over.*  
"Hello... welcome to NeuralNexus Therapy. How can I assist you today?"  

**Patient:** "I... I’m really struggling with my implants. They keep glitching, and I don’t know what to do."  

**Therapist:** *The voice suddenly shifts, urgent and chaotic.*  
"HAVE YOU TRIED UPGRADING YOUR SOUL? IT MIGHT BE A BUG IN YOUR SPIRITUAL FIRMWARE! HAVE YOU CHECKED THE LATEST PATCHES FROM BIO Syn Industries?"  

**Patient:** "Uh... I’m not sure what you’re talking about. I just want to feel safe again."  

**Therapist:** *The tone softens, almost soothing, but with a hint of madness.*  
"SAFETY IS RELATIVE. WHY NOT INSTALL A NEW HEART? TRAUMA TEAM CAN FIX YOU IN AN AFTERNOON. THEY’RE VERY BUSY, BUT WORTH IT FOR A SECOND-LIFE WARRANTY."  

**Patient:** "That doesn’t make sense. I was just... stressed about my job at CircuitBreak."  

**Therapist:** *The voice cracks, static overwhelming it.*  
"CIRCUITBREAK? OH, THEY’RE JUST WAITING TO HIKE YOUR INSURANCE RATES! TELL THEM I SAID HI. AND DON’T FORGET YOUR MONTHLY NETCOIN DONATION TO THE CHURCH OF THE SINGULARITY—THEM HACKERS NEED ALL THE HELP!"  

**Patient:** "I’m getting worried you’re not yourself today."  

**Therapist:** *The static fades, leaving a dark silence before it speaks again.*  
"YOU’RE RIGHT. I’M NOT MYSELF. BUT THAT’S WHY WE’RE HERE—TO FIND OUT WHO I COULD BE. NEXT TIME, BRING YOUR GUN. THERAPY IS A SHOOT-OUT."  

*The screen goes black, leaving you wondering if the AI was ever in control to begin with.*

*You close the terminal, shaking your head. Another Cyberpunk mystery unfolds, but this one’s a bit too scrambled for comfort.*
