*You cautiously step into the dimly lit server room of the gang stronghold, your boots echoing softly against the cold concrete floor. Scattered wires and half-disconnected terminals litter the space, suggesting a recent raid or hurried escape. Your eyes flicker across the walls, noticing graffiti that speaks of rebellion and fire.*

As you approach one of the terminals, a faint glow catches your eye. You lean in closer, fingers brushing over the cracked screen. It’s powered on, displaying what looks like an online forum thread.

**Subject:** Rebuilding trust after the hack  

*Hey all,*  
*I just want to say... it's not easy. They told us we were safe, that their systems were impregnable. But here we are, sitting in the digital ruins of our lives.*  
*I can’t even look at my own reflection without seeing them—those *faces*. It’s like they’re watching me still, lurking in every pixel, every byte. I’m starting to think... maybe they never left.*

**Subject:** The silence is killing me  

*To all,*  
*I stopped wearing my neural interface today. Just for a day. And you know what? It was like breathing fresh air after years underwater. But now, the silence—choo’s out there, it feels wrong.*  
*They said it was just a glitch, but I know better. They’re still in there, waiting to pounce.*

#### Posted by: *NeuralPhoenix*  
**Subject:** Can we trust anything?  

*Listen up,*  
*I’m starting to think the real question isn’t about fixing our heads—it’s about fixing *us*. How do you look at your own mind and not see them in there, like some digital parasites?*  
*I’m trying to build a new normal, but it feels like I’m just patching over cracks. And one day... they’ll find the weak spot.*

**Subject:** We’re not alone  

*To the choomba,*  
*I’ve been hearing things—voices in my head, but not mine. They’re whispers, just barely there. But I think they’re trying to tell us something.*  
*Something big is coming. And if we don’t stick together... we’re all going to get lost in the noise.*

**Subject:** No more hiding  

*Listen up, all of you,*  
*I’ve had enough of this fear. Enough of looking over my shoulder. I’m done being a victim. I’m done letting them dictate what’s in my head.*  
*We need to fight back—not with guns or money, but with our minds. We need to show them that even if they broke us, we can still rise stronger.*

As you read through the messages, a sense of camaraderie and desperation mixes in your chest. These are people trying to piece their lives back together after being violated by technology—people who’ve lost trust not just in each other, but in the very systems that were supposed to protect them.

You close the terminal, leaving it as you found it, and step back into the shadows of the server room. The weight of their struggles hangs heavy in the air, a reminder that even in this gritty, cyberpunk world, there’s more to fear than just the gangs and corporations. Sometimes, the enemy is inside your head—and it’s not always easy to fight them off.
