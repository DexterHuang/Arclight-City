*You flicked on the dim light of your cyberdeck, the faint glow casting shadows across the walls of this abandoned gang hideout. The air was thick with the stench of rust and decay, a far cry from the neon-drenched streets outside. You scrolled through the files on the terminal, each folder labeled with cryptic names and dates. One file stood out—marked "PRIVATE" in bold red letters. Curiosity piqued, you opened it.*

> *The nightmare still haunts me every night. I can’t forget the screams, the chaos, the sheer horror of that day. It was just another ordinary morning when everything changed. My family and I were in CircuitBreak HQ, my father had landed a high-paying gig with them. We thought it was safe, a ticket to the good life. But then...*
>
> *The explosion happened at noon. A blinding flash of light, followed by a deafening roar that shook the very foundations of the building. I remember running, my lungs burning as I dragged my little sister through the smoke-filled corridors. People were everywhere—screaming, crying, broken bodies. The air was thick with ash and the acrid stench of burned metal.*
>
> *We made it out alive, but nothing would ever be the same. My parents... they didn’t survive. The official report said it was a terrorist attack, a black-market tactical nuclear bomb detonated in the building. But what they don’t tell you is how the blast vaporized entire floors, how the survivors were left to fend for themselves in the chaos.*
>
> *CircuitBreak rebuilt their tower, bigger and better than before, but the truth behind what happened that day remains buried. The government covered it up, blaming it on some rogue faction. But I know better. My sister and I were there. We saw the destruction firsthand.*
>
> *Now, all I have is this journal to keep the memories alive. And a burning hatred for those who let this happen. For those who profit from our suffering.*

*You read through the entry again, the words blurring in the faint light. The writer’s anger and pain were palpable, their voice echoing through the empty room. You couldn’t help but feel a chill—this wasn’t just a piece of history; it was a raw, personal account of loss and betrayal.*
