*You found a flickering terminal in the corner of the gang's stronghold, its screen crackling with static. The cursor blinks slowly as if hesitant to reveal what lies beyond the glow of the monitor.*

I never thought I'd be the one writing this. A mercenary's life is all about survival, but sometimes the choices you make stick with you like a bad implant that won't shut off.

It started like any other job. *CircuitBreak* approached me through the usual channels—the Whispperer at the Red Bar. She mentioned a high-paying gig: infiltrate MegaEstate's downtown office and retrieve their encrypted data files. Simple enough, right? But I was told there were others after the same prize—other mercs, maybe even some corporate muscle.

I didn't think much of it at the time. I suited up, checked my cyberwear, and headed into the city. The target was a sleek glass tower in the heart of downtown, security systems humming like a hive of angry bees. My plan was to slip in under the radar, bypass their defenses, and make off with the data before anyone noticed.

But that's where things started to unravel.

I got inside without much trouble, thanks to my *NeuroLink* implant slicing through their firewalls like butter. The files were just a few clicks away when I heard footsteps—loud, drunken laughter spilling down the corridor. My heart skipped a beat as I realized it wasn't just me in there.

A group of civilians had broken into the building, drawn by rumors of black market goods being stored in the offices. They were ransacking the place, their eyes wide with greed. I tried to stay hidden, but one of them noticed my shadow on the wall.

"Hey! Who's there?" he shouted, fumbling with a laser cutter.

I had to make a choice. I could take them out quietly, but they'd be dead before they hit the ground. Or I could let them live and risk getting caught myself. There was no time for hesitation—I activated my *Foghorn* implant, sending a pulse that knocked them all unconscious in one fell swoop.

The guilt hit me harder than any bullet ever could. Those people were just looking for a way to escape the slums, to give themselves a shot at something better. But because of me, they're gone now. I left the building with the data, but the blood of those innocents clings to my hands like a cybernetic scar.

*The terminal falls silent as you step back, the weight of Dolli Young's words hanging in the air. The room feels colder somehow, the neon lights flickering like ghosts.*
