Headline: **Church of Pachinko Cultists Arrested After Deadly Rampage**

By: *Jane Smith*

In a shocking turn of events yesterday evening, members of the infamous Church of Pachinko were arrested after going on a deadly rampage near the Data Haven District. Eye witness accounts report seeing these individuals wielding modified pachinko machines as weapons against innocent civilians.

According to authorities, the incident began when two rival gangs started fighting over control of a lucrative smuggling route near the Data Haven District. As usual, both sides resorted to violence which quickly escalated into chaos. It wasn't until several calls about armed men roaming around came in that law enforcement arrived on scene. By then however, it was too late – numerous bodies littered the streets while others lay wounded crying for help.

Amongst those apprehended were several key figures within the Church including its leader, Reverend Jack Lee. When asked why they would resort to such senseless violence given their supposed devotion towards Pachinko, Reverend Lee replied with tears streaming down his face: "We didn't mean for this... We just got caught up in the heat of battle..." His words fell flat though as evidence mounted suggesting otherwise.

This latest incident serves as another grim reminder of how far some will go for power and profit amidst Arclight City’s never ending cycle of greed and despair. Our thoughts remain with those affected by this tragedy during these trying times.
