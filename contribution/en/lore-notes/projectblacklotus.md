*You step into the dimly lit clinic, the air thick with the metallic scent of antiseptics and the faint hum of advanced medical machinery. The walls are lined with rows of cryo chambers and holographic patient files flickering in the dark. A single terminal near the entrance catches your eye, its screen glowing faintly with blue light.*

*You pull up the attached video log, the grainy footage showing a suited doctor injecting a glowing liquid into a restrained patient. The camera shakes as the patient suddenly bolts forward, their eyes wide with terror.*

**Dr. Voss**: "Hold him down! He's reacting badly to the serum!"  
**Nurse:** "I—I think it's working too well... His neural pathways are lighting up like a Christmas tree!"

*The video cuts out with a scream of pain and a crash of equipment. Static fills the screen before cutting to black.*

> **Final Note Found in Console:**  
> *"If you're reading this, I'm already dead. Find 'Lotus Protocol' before they erase all traces. They’re using real organic stuff... not synthetics like they said."*

*The terminal beeps softly as a new file pops up: "LOTUS_PROTOCOL.DAT".*
