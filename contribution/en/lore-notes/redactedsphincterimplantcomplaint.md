*You ducked into an abandoned room, searching for anything useful. The walls were graffitied with gang symbols, and the air was thick with tension. Your eyes caught a flicker of light from an old terminal on the far wall. You approached it cautiously, your cybernetic eye scanning the screen.*

> **To: BioSyn Industries Customer Service**  
> **Subject: Urgent Recall Request for Defective Product - "Smart-Sphincter"Implant**

> Dear BioSyn Support,

> I am writing to express my extreme dissatisfaction with the performance of your latest product, the "Smart-Sphincter" implant. While I initially believed this device would enhance my digestive efficiency and social interactions, it has instead become a source of constant embarrassment and professional ruin.

> The malfunction began during an important client meeting at Lilith's shop. Without any warning, the implant activated its "auto-release mode," resulting in a series of uncontrollable, melodic flatulence. The device appeared to target high-stress situations, as another incident occurred during a tense negotiation with CircuitBreak mercenaries, where it released a synchronized sequence of noises that could only be described as a symphony of awkwardness.

> I have attempted to contact your customer service line multiple times via Netcoin, but each call ends in an automated message informing me that "all insured lives are prioritized." When I inquired about this, a representative responded with a cryptic quote from the Church of the Singularity regarding AI ascension, which did little to alleviate my concerns.

> For the sake of my reputation and sanity, I urge you to issue an immediate recall. Until this is resolved, I will be unable to conduct any professional business without risking further social exile or, worse, a hit from Trauma Team's "assisted termination" services.

> Sincerely,  
> **[REDACTED]**  
> Eurodollar Amount: 500 Eddies Spent

*You smirked slightly. This was the most entertaining complaint you'd ever read. As you packed up the terminal, you couldn't help but wonder what other cybernetic mishaps lurked in this city.*
