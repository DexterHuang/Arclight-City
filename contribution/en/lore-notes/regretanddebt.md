*You found a crumpled piece of paper tucked inside an old datapad near the gang leader's desk. The screen flickers slightly as you approach, casting a dim blue light on the worn text.*

> I never thought I'd feel this way. The void, it's calling me again. A voice in the dark, or maybe just my own echoes. Payments to Oriana were supposed to erase the pain, but what if I traded one nightmare for another?  

> *The first time, it was easy.* Cash on the table, a quick injection, and then—nothing. No more screams, no more faces haunting my every step. But now... fragments. Bits of what I thought was gone. A shadow in the alley, a laugh over the comms, a name I can't place.  

> *Why did I think this would fix me?* Maybe I wanted it to. Maybe I was scared. Scared of facing the choices that got me here, or the people who still wait for me on the other side of this debt.  

> Chloe at the Red Bar says memory isn’t meant to be erased. She doesn’t know what she’s talking about—she just pours drinks and listens. But she’s right in a way. What if I’m not ready to let go?  

> *The bills pile up, and so do the memories.* A face, distorted by static but familiar—was that someone from before? Or was it just another figment of my fraying mind?  

> **Oriana's note** still clings to the datapad: "Debt is a two-way street. Pay up or get creative."  

> I wish I could laugh, but there’s nothing left to joke about. The city doesn’t sleep, and neither do the ghosts in my head.  

> *Maybe I should’ve never trusted the Black Market.* Maybe I should’ve walked away when I had the chance. But here I am, drowning in fragments of a life I thought I buried.
