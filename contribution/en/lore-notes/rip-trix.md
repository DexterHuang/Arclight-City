*You carefully stepped over the puddle of viscous green liquid that had pooled in the corner of the room, your boots squelching slightly as you approached the flickering terminal on the wall. The glow of its cracked screen cast eerie shadows across the walls, which were adorned with crude posters advertising "exclusive" cybernetic enhancements. You couldn't help but wonder who would risk their life here, in this dump.*

*Another day, another tragedy. Just like clockwork, the Black Marketclinic pulled another one off. They promised paradise in a syringe, but all they delivered was death.*  

*Trix Edwards was just a girl from the slums, desperate to make it big. She heard about the "miracle" procedure that would give her sharper vision and faster reflexes—everything she needed to land that lucrative gig as a courier. But she didn't know what she was getting into.*  

*The place stank of antiseptic and regret. The doctor, some shady slicer named "Kiko," promised quick in-and-out. He said the procedure would be "simple" and "low-risk." Trix didn’t even flinch when he pulled out the tools. But then the green goo started leaking from her eyes, her voice cracked like static, and she started screaming about needles in her brain.*  

*I heard the commotion while I was running my usual route. A crowd had gathered outside, muttering about "another failed run" and "black market greed." I pushed through to see Trix lying on the floor, her body spasming as Kiko and his crew scrambled to pack up and disappear. They didn’t even bother covering up the mess.*  

*By the time the ACPD showed up—probably after someone pressed the panic button—they were too late. The clinic was already gone, leaving Trix to rot in that alley. Her body’s still there if you want a look, but I wouldn’t recommend it. The stench alone might kill you.*  

*Another name added to the list of those who dared to trust the Black Market. Another soul lost to the gamble of upgrade.*

*You hesitated for a moment before pressing the power button on the terminal. It hummed to life, revealing a grainy video log of the incident. The doctor's smug face flickered on the screen as he sterilized his tools, completely unfazed by the chaos that would ensue. Trix’s screams echoed through the room, a haunting reminder of the risks people take in this unequal world.*
