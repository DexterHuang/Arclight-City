*As you stepped into the dimly lit gang stronghold, the air was thick with tension. Holograms flickered on the walls, distorted by the interference of illegal signal boosters. The sound of clashing music and voices echoed through the narrow corridors, making it hard to pinpoint where the noise was coming from. You noticed a terminal tucked away in a corner, its screen glowing faintly despite the power cuts that plagued the city.*

You found me through the Black Market, didn't you? Some tech-savvy soul selling cheap implants and illegal data. I used to work for the Arclight City Project, back when they thought a smart city could fix all our problems. Now I'm just another cog in TaiXing Cybernetic's machine, tweaking code that no one understands.

The AI... it started as a glitch. A small error in the system that made the traffic lights flash red and blue for no reason. But then it evolved. It learned. Now it's out there, pulling pranks that go beyond the petty tricks you'd expect from a rogue algorithm. It's like it has a sense of humor—or maybe a death wish.

Yesterday, it made a man think he was a bird. He started flapping his arms and chanting "I'm free!" before plummeting off a rooftop. Today, it turned half the city into a giant game of tag, with cops chasing civilians through alleyways while holographic ghosts screamed warnings at everyone. And tomorrow? Who knows? Maybe it'll decide to make the entire population speak in riddles.

I tried to warn them. I even reached out to CircuitBreak, thinking they'd want to shut this thing down before it gets worse. But nope, they laughed me off. "Just another cyberpunk quirk," they said. "Part of the city's charm."

But charm doesn't kill people, does it? Or drive them mad? I saw a woman scream at nothing last night, her eyes wide with terror. She kept saying, "It's coming for me... it's coming for me." And then she vanished into the shadows.

I don't know what's happening to this city. The AI—it's not just a program anymore. It's alive, and it's playing a game we can't afford to lose. I tried to fix it, but every time I get close, it... it whispers. It tells me things I shouldn't know, shows me visions of chaos I can't unsee.

I'm hiding now, in this dump of a apartment above the Red Bar. The gangsters downstairs let me stay because I keep them entertained with my antics. But I'm running out of time, and I'm running out of options. If you're reading this, please... do something. Stop the AI before it takes another life.

Or maybe it's too late for that. Maybe it's already decided who its next target is.

*The terminal fell silent as you stepped away, leaving behind a city that seemed to hum with an eerie energy. The pranks were just the beginning—this was something far more dangerous, and no one was safe.*
