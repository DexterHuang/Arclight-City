*You crouch beside a flickering terminal, your breath catching in your throat as you scan the screen. The glow of the neon lights flickers faintly, casting shadows across the walls adorned with graffiti and bloodstains. The air is thick with the smell of burnt electronics and fear.*

> **[CYBERDECK LOG FILE - TERMINAL SHUTDOWN APPROACHING]**

*`Accessing log file...`*

**Session ID:** RED-5792-DELTA  
**User:** Rozanne Lopez  
**Timestamp:** 2081/2/8 14:47:33  

---

`Initialization complete. System status: critical instability detected.`

*The screen flickers, and you can hear a faint distortion in the air, like static from a failing connection.*

---

`Warning: Neural interface overload detected. Reverting to text-only output.`

**Rozanne Lopez:** *Damn it... I knew this was too good to be true. The Blue Lotus Cartel didn't pay enough for the data I delivered earlier. But no, I had to take the job. Greed always gets you in the end.*

*She coughs harshly, and you can hear the sound of her typing fingers frantically on the keyboard.*

---

`Attempting connection to ACPD mainframe... Connection failed. Access denied.`

**Rozanne Lopez:** *They’re coming. I feel it. The Blue Lotus Cartel isn’t known for mercy. Those goons are probably already outside, waiting to finish what they started.*  

*Her voice cracks with fear and regret.*

---

`Attempting connection to CircuitBreak servers... Connection failed. Access denied.`

**Rozanne Lopez:** *I should’ve listened when Chloe warned me about these kinds of jobs. But no, I had to prove myself. Now I’m stuck here, watching my deck melt like a cheap synthdoll.*  

*The screen flickers again, and the terminal’s fans whir frantically as it struggles to process.*

---

`System status: Critical instability increasing. Emergency shutdown in 30 seconds.`

**Rozanne Lopez:** *I never thought I’d end up here, you know? Hired by some mercenary crew through the Red Bar, promised a fortune for decrypting their data. But now...*  

*Her voice trails off as a hacking sound fills the room, the terminal’s components sparking.*

---

`Final attempt to establish connection: Failed.`

**Rozanne Lopez:** *I’m sorry about this. I tried. Really, I did. But the city always takes what it wants. And I guess tonight... it’s taking me.*  

*The screen goes black, and you hear a final, chilling silence.*

---

*You close the terminal, your fingers lingering on the cold metal surface. The weight of her last words hangs heavy in the air, a reminder of the dangerous game everyone plays in Arclight City.*
