*You crouch behind a overturned desk, your eyes scanning the dimly lit room for any signs of movement. The air is thick with the scent of smoke and blood, a reminder of the chaos that unfolded mere hours ago. Your cybernetic implants hum faintly as they process the environment, picking up the subtle frequencies of the city’s endless noise outside the walls.*

*Your attention drifts to the terminal on the far wall, its screen flickering sporadically. You approach it cautiously, your hand resting on the grip of your sidearm. The screen lights up, revealing a fragmented log file. It seems someone left a message here, their words etched in haste and desperation.*

> *Aurora here. We weren’t supposed to get this deep into it. But when the signal came in, we couldn’t resist. The payout was too good, and we thought we could handle it.*  
>  
> *We were hired by some corporate bigwig—face never showed, just a voice on the com. Said they needed intel from TaiXing Cybernetic’s main branch. Easy enough, right? Just a quick data grab and we’re gone.*  
>  
> *But then things went sideways. The security systems kicked in faster than expected. My head says it was a mistake, but my gut told me something wasn’t right. We had to take them down, hard.*

> *Now I’m sitting here, staring at the bodies. Civvies. Innocents caught in the crossfire. A kid, no older than 16, his face all messed up from a stray round. His sister—she was screaming when they took her out. Choomba, what were we thinking?*

> *The job was supposed to be clean. But now it’s stained with blood. I don’t know if I can live with this. Maybe the pay will help me forget, but it won’t bring back the dead.*

*You read through the words again, feeling the weight of the writer’s guilt and confusion. The mention of TaiXing Cybernetic suggests this was a corporate job, likely orchestrated by one of the Mega Corps that rules the elite sections of Arclight City. The reference to “civvies” and the loss of innocence in the operation paints a grim picture of a mercenary grappling with the moral fallout.*  

*As you step back from the terminal, you notice a small device on the floor—a data chip, perhaps the one they were sent to retrieve. It glows faintly, its presence a silent testament to the mission that went wrong. The room feels heavier now, the air thick with the weight of regret and violence.*  

*You wonder who Aurora is, where she is now, and whether she’s still trying to forget—or if she’s become one of the many cyberpsychos haunting the streets.*
