*You stepped into the dimly lit gang stronghold, the air thick with the scent of sweat and burnt electronics. Your eyes flickered over the scattered debris and broken terminals, stopping at a small terminal on the wall. You approached it, curiosity piqued, and noticed an open file.*

Dear BioSyn Customer Service,  

I hope this message finds you in a state of extreme discomfort, as I currently am. Let me start by saying that I’ve always been an advocate for cutting-edge cybernetic enhancements. My Smart-Sphincter Implant was supposed to be the pinnacle of modern technology—a seamless integration of human and machine, designed to enhance my digestive efficiency and overall bowel management.  

But here we are.  

**Approximately 3 days ago:** I underwent the implantation procedure at one of your authorized facilities. The surgery went smoothly (or so they told me). I was assured that this device would revolutionize my life, allowing me to control every aspect of my bodily functions with precision and elegance.  

**What Actually Happened:**  

- **Day 1:** The implant activated as expected. It provided real-time feedback on my digestive tract, which was… *interesting*. I received notifications about my bowel movements via my neural interface, which was both intrusive and oddly satisfying.  

- **Day 2:** The system started acting strange. Notifications began to flood my brain, overriding my ability to concentrate. “Bowel pressure increasing!” “Potential release in 3 seconds!” “Adjusting sphincter tension…” It felt like I was running a marathon while my body decided to interpret every movement as a signal to let loose.  

- **Day 3:** This is where things took a turn for the worse. The implant completely lost all functionality, or rather, it gained new, unintended functionality. Now, it’s constantly emitting a low-frequency hum that only I can hear, and it’s *urging* me to… let’s say “express myself” at every opportunity.  

**Examples of Inconvenience:**  
- During an important meeting with my crew, the implant triggered a loud, melodic fart that echoed through the room. I was laughed out of the bar.  
- While negotiating a high-paying gig, the system decided to override my sphincter entirely, resulting in an “unplanned release” on the doorstep of Trauma Team’s office. Let’s just say their security team wasn’t amused.  
- And yesterday, during a date with this one girl—no, I can’t even talk about it.  

**Technical Details:**  
- Implant Model: BioSyn Smart-Sphincter MK-II  
- Serial Number: BSX-FG-789452  
- Firmware Version: 3.1.0-Beta  
- Error Code: “Frequency Override Protocol Activated” (Code: FOP-999)  

**Conclusion:**  
I’ve tried everything—resetting the implant, cycling power, even attempting a manual override via my neural interface (which was a disaster). The only thing that worked temporarily was unplugging my brain from the grid, but that’s not exactly a sustainable solution.  

Please fix this. I’m not asking for much—a functional digestive system would be nice. Or at least send me a refund so I can invest in something less… *vocal*.  

Sincerely,  
Brier Collins  
(Implant ID: BSX-FG-789452)

*You read through the complaint, chuckling despite yourself. The absurdity of it all was both hilarious and terrifying. Whoever wrote this had clearly been through something nightmarish—and they weren’t alone.*
