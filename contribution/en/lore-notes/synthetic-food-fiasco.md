*As you were looting the stronghold, you noticed a cyberdeck on a table, with a message open.*

*You found an unlocked laptop with a file on the desktop. Clicking it reveals a document written in frantic scrawl.*

> "This was supposed to be a joke, right? Some sick prank by the organizers. But now I'm sitting here, my hands trembling so bad I can barely type this. The competition... it started like any other synthetic food tasting event. Glowing neon signs flashed as we walked in, the crowd buzzing with excitement. The host was some suave asshole named Viktor, always smirking like he'd just won the lottery. 'Tonight,' he said, 'we'll taste the future.' Yeah, right."

> "The first few courses were fine—synthetic caviar that actually popped like real eggs, a 'lobster bisque' that was more VR illusion than actual food. But then came the main event: the mystery dish. Viktor handed us tiny plates with something that looked like... I don't know, gray sludge? He winked and said, 'Taste this, and you'll never look at synthetic food the same way again.'"

> "I didn't even realize what was happening until it was too late. The first bite—fuck, it was real. Actual organic meat. You could tell by the texture, the smell, everything. I looked around, and everyone else was freaking out too. One guy started screaming about how it tasted like lamb, another said it was beef. Some kid in a corner started crying."

> "That's when the chaos began. People were scrambling to get more, shoving each other just to get another bite. The organizers tried to stop us, but we weren't listening. We wanted more. More of that real taste, anything to break the monotony of synthetic crap. I saw one guy pull out a knife and threaten a server—said he'd gut him if he didn't hand over the kitchen."

> "Then things got worse. The organizers announced it was all fake, some kind of marketing stunt. But no one believed them. Someone shouted that there was real food somewhere in the building, and suddenly everyone was tearing apart walls, flipping tables. I barely made it out with my life, tripping over bodies and broken glass."

> "I don't know what happened after that. The city's going to be talking about this for years, probably another reason for the ACPD to crackdown on us 'cyberpsychos.' But all I can think of is how close we were—how close any of us could've been—to finding something real again."

> "Maybe next time, they'll think twice before claiming their competition is just a joke."

*The document ends abruptly. The screen flickers for a moment before going dark.*

*You wonder what Kirstyn Thomas did next—if she escaped the city or got caught in the crossfire of some mercenary crew. But one thing is clear: her story paints a vivid picture of Arclight City's darker side, where desperation and greed can turn even the most civilized events into a bloodbath.*
