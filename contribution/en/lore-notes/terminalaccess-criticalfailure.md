*You approached a flickering terminal in the corner of the stronghold, its screen crackling with static. The glow of the monitor cast eerie shadows on the walls as you leaned closer, your fingers brushing against the cold metal surface.*

**Message from: Kael Veyra**

*You found a terminal with a message from someone named Kael Veyra. The screen flickers as if it's about to shut down permanently.*

---

**[BEGIN TRANSCRIPT]**

*Adriaens Ramirez hacks into the mainframe, but the system is already crashing. Static distorts the audio feed.*

**Kael Veyra**: "This... this isn't right. I knew something was off when the payment was too good. They said it was just a simple hack, but they lied."

*The screen flickers, and for a moment, you see a distorted image of a man in his late twenties, wearing a faded hoodie with mismatched cyberwear. His eyes are wide with fear.*

**Kael Veyra**: "I shouldn't have taken the job. I told myself not to, but the credits... they were too tempting. Now I'm stuck here, trapped in this virtual nightmare."

*The static grows louder, and the image becomes harder to make out.*

**Kael Veyra**: "I think I messed with something I couldn't handle. The system's collapsing, and I can't get out. My implants are glitching... I can feel it. They're not just tools anymore—they’re part of me, and they're failing."

*His voice cracks as he struggles to breathe.*

**Kael Veyra**: "I'm sorry if this doesn’t make sense. I’ve always been a lone wolf, but... choomba, whoever finds this, I hope you can understand. Don't let what happened to me happen to others."

*Suddenly, the screen goes black for a second before flickering back to life.*

**Kael Veyra**: "I'm not going to make it. The core's melting down faster than预计. My logs... they’re all I have left. If you can get them out, tell someone, anyone, what happened here."

*The static grows unbearable, and the voice cuts off mid-sentence.*

**[END TRANSCRIPT]**

*As you read through the logs, a chill runs down your spine. The terminal starts to overheat, and the screen begins to flicker one last time before going dark.*
