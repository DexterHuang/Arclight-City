*As you were looting the stronghold, you noticed an old terminal on a desk, its screen flickering faintly. Curious, you decided to have a look.*

*The screen glitches briefly before stabilizing.*

**Esta Flores**: "I knew this day would come. The walls are closing in, and I can’t get out. The code—I swear I saw a glitch, a window to escape. But it’s not here anymore."

**Esta Flores**: "I’m trapped in this collapsing matrix. The net is eating itself, and I can’t keep up. My fingers are trembling... I can barely type."

**Esta Flores**: "I’ve seen this before. In sims, in nightmares. The virtual constructs—they’re not just code. They’re alive, and they’re dying. And when they die... we die with them."

*The screen flickers violently as static begins to overwhelm the display.*

**Esta Flores**: "I’m sorry, whoever finds this. I didn’t mean to drag you into this... if this log even makes it out. My sister—she’s still out there somewhere. Tell her I tried."

*The screen goes black, then flickers one last time.*

**Esta Flores**: "Goodbye... I hope the net doesn’t take you too slowly."

*The terminal falls silent, its screen dark and cold.*
