*You step into the dimly lit room of the gang stronghold, your eyes scanning the surroundings for any clues or threats. The air is thick with the scent of sweat and oil, and the sound of distant gunfire echoes through the narrow corridors. Your mission is to gather intel and take down the rival gang's leader, but before you dive into action, something catches your eye—a flickering terminal on the wall.*

*You approach the terminal, noticing it's slightly ajar. A small slip of paper is wedged under the door. You pull it out, and the faint glow of the screen reflects off the paper in your hand. It’s a note, scrawled with quick, messy handwriting:*

**The Report**

*Hey,*

*I’m not sure what’s going on here, but I think you’ll want to see this. Some mercenary named "V" has been hitting the headlines again. They’re talking about a job in the Red Bar district yesterday—cleaned out an entire crew of mercenaries without breaking a sweat. They say V’s got some serious skills, like they’re a ghost or something.*

*But who are they working for? No one knows. Just left this message on the bar’s terminal before vanishing into the shadows. Some people think it’s the CircuitBreak安保公司 hiring them, but I don’t buy it. They usually keep their operations quiet. Others say it’s the Church of the Singularity—they’re always looking for new talent to upload.*

*Whatever the case, stay sharp out there. V doesn’t play nice.*

—*A concerned citizen*

*The note falls silent, leaving you wondering who could be behind this mysterious mercenary. You pocket the slip and head deeper into the stronghold, your mind racing with possibilities.*
