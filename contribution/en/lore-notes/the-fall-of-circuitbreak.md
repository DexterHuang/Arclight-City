*You carefully sift through the belongings scattered in the gang’s stronghold when you stumble upon an old journal tucked away in a forgotten corner. The leather-bound book is worn, its edges frayed, but the words inside are still sharp with emotion.*

**[Diary Entry: October 12, 2047]**  
*The city was alive that day, bustling with the usual chaos. I never imagined it would be my last normal day. Choomba and I were just kids back then, full of hope and laughter.*  

*We used to hang around the CircuitBreak HQ, marveling at its sleek towers that pierced the skyline. It was a symbol of power and progress, or so we thought. Little did we know, it would become a tomb.*  

*That morning, everything changed. The news broke like a shockwave—CircuitBreak HQ was under attack. I remember the scream, the blinding light, and the ground shaking beneath my feet. The terrorists had struck with something big, something beyond anything we’d seen before. They detonated a black-market tactical nuke, and the building collapsed in an inferno.*  

*I lost everything that day. Choomba didn’t make it. Neither did my sister, who worked there. The government covered it up quickly, saying it was an accident, but I know better. They’re hiding the truth, just like they always do.*  

*Since then, I’ve been drifting, trying to piece myself together. The cyberwear I got later helps me cope—numbs the pain, gives me a false sense of security. But it’s not enough. Nothing will ever be enough.*  

*I wonder if those responsible are still out there. If they are, maybe justice isn’t too late…*
