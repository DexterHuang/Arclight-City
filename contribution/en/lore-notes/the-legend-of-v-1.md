*As you stepped through the dimly lit corridors of the gang stronghold, the air thick with the stench of sweat and burning electronics, your boots echoed against the cold metal floors. You paused by a flickering terminal, its screen cracked but still functional, and decided to take a closer look.*

> **Subject:** The Legend of "V"  
> **Date:** 2084/1/8

*The city is abuzz with whispers of a mercenary known only as "V." A shadowy figure who operates with precision, leaving no trace but the bodies of their targets. Recent reports from Hana's Vlog suggest V has taken on high-profile gigs—rescuing hostages from the clutches of the ACPD and eliminating corporate executives who’ve wronged the streets.*

*Hana’s voice crackled through a recent vid log, her usual bubbly tone tinged with awe:*

**Hana:** "Y’all, I’m not kidding when I say this—’V’ is the real deal. They took down an entire ACPD squad that was hunting down some harmless street hackers just for fun! Can you believe it? And then they vanished without a trace. It’s like they’re a ghost in the system!"*

---

*The report goes on to speculate about V’s origins, theorizing they might be a high-tier mercenary who’s been operating under the radar for years. Some even whisper that V could be linked to Zero Byte, the enigmatic hacker known for their cryptic messages and elusive nature.*

---

*You scrolled through more logs, finding a snippet of encrypted data:*

**"V is not a solo operator—she’s part of something bigger. When she takes you on, she doesn’t fight alone. But no one knows who pulls her strings."**

*The terminal suddenly beeped, flashing a message in green text:*

`> Accessing restricted files...  
> Found: "Operation Midnight Flash"  
> Target: Trauma Team’s Director  
> Status: Mission Complete`

---

*You leaned closer to the screen as it flickered one last time before going dark. The report was gone, but the memory of V’s deeds lingered in your mind like a ghostly echo.*

`> System shutting down...`

---

*As you walked away from the terminal, a chill ran down your spine. Who was this "V"? And why did they leave no trace behind? The streets of Arclight City were dangerous enough without legends like them—especially if they were working for someone or something bigger.*
