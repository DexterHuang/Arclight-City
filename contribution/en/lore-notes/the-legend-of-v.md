*As you were looting the stronghold, you noticed a terminal on the wall, its screen flickering with static. Curiosity piqued, you decided to have a look.*

*The screen darkened for a moment before lighting up again, displaying the words above. Below, a grainy video began to play.*  

**[Video Log Begins]**  

*A flickering camera shows a dimly lit room with a single desk and a chair. A shadowy figure sits behind the desk, their face obscured by the low light. The voice that follows is deep and gravelly, with a faint cybernetic hum underlying it.*

**Unknown Speaker:** "They call me V. Just... V."  

*The camera zooms in on the figure's hand, which rests on the desk. The fingers are adorned with intricate cyberwear, glowing faintly in the dark. The screen flickers again, and when it stabilizes, the figure stands up, their silhouette towering over the desk.*

**Unknown Speaker:** "I don't do this for glory. I do it for the coin. And the challenge."  

*The video cuts to a montage of V in action: dodging gunfire in narrow alleys, hacking into security systems with flawless precision, and leading a small team of mercenaries through chaotic firefights. The images are grainy but capture the intensity of each scene.*

**Unknown Speaker:** "But you're not here for my story. You're here because someone sent you to find me. Someone who knows what I am capable of."  

*The screen flickers剧烈地, and for a moment, it looks like the connection is lost. When it returns, the figure is now holding a sleek cyberdeck, their fingers flying across the holographic keyboard with practiced ease.*

**Unknown Speaker:** "I don't know who you are, but if you're looking for me... be careful. The job that hired me didn’t do it for the right reasons."  

*The video ends abruptly, leaving you wondering what V is referring to.*

> **Additional Notes from Ashlie Phillips:**  
> Found this terminal in a backroom of the gang's stronghold. It seems like someone was trying to document or warn others about this mysterious mercenary known as "V." The mention of being hired by "the right reasons" suggests there's more to V’s story than meets the eye. Could it be the Mega Corporations? Or maybe one of the other shadowy organizations in Arclight City?  

*The terminal hums softly, and you can't help but feel a chill run down your spine. Whoever V is, they’re not just a mercenary—they’re a legend, shrouded in mystery and danger.*
