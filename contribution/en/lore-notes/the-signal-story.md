*You stumbled upon a dimly lit room in the gang stronghold, the air thick with tension. Graffiti covered the walls, and a faint trail of dried blood led to a crumpled piece of paper near the shattered remains of a chair.*

*Let me tell you, I’ve seen some messed-up things in Arclight City, but this? This takes the cake. It was just another night—raiding, scoring netcoins, and trying to stay alive in these slums. We were a small crew, just choomba friends looking for an easy score. But then… she showed up.*  

**The Incident:**  
It started with a whisper, like static hissing through my ears. Then the door burst open. She was a sight to behold—glowing eyes, skin peeled back to reveal circuitry, and a mouth full of metal teeth. A proper cyberpsycho, if I ever saw one. The gangs called her "The Signal," but tonight, she wasn’t sending any good vibes.  

**The Madness:**  
She moved like liquid metal, taking down my crew in seconds. One choom tried to fight back with a nailboard, but she snapped his arm like a twig. Another pal? Let’s just say he didn’t make it past the door. I ducked under a table, praying the vibrations of her stomping feet wouldn’t crush me flat.  

**The Aftermath:**  
When it was over, the silence was deafening. The Signal stood in the middle of the room, breathing heavily—like she was a machine that needed recharging. Then, without so much as a glance back, she walked out. Just like that.  

*Now I’m here, alive but barely. My body’s patched up with whatever I could scavenge—a few nano-packs and some basic medigel. The streets are safer at night now? Nah, fool. But one thing’s for sure: Arclight City’s got a way of keeping you humble.*  

**Final Thoughts:**  
Beware the allure of too much cyberwear. It might keep you alive longer, but it’ll turn your brain to static faster than you can say "choomba." And when The Signal comes knocking, there’s no such thing as being prepared.

*The note ends abruptly, leaving you with a lingering sense of unease. You wonder if the survivor is still out there, or if they met the same fate as their crew.*
