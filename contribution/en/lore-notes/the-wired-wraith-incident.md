**Excerpt from Hana's Article:**  
*Date: 2087/11/1*  
*Location: Arclight City, Docks District*  

Arclight City sure knows how to keep things interesting. Last night, the city faced its worst cyberpsycho attack in months. The creature—dubbed "The Wired Wraith"—left a trail of destruction that even the ACPD had to step back from. But here’s the kicker: it wasn’t the cops who took him down. It was CircuitBreak, the shadowy security firm with more secrets than a vault.  

The attack started around 10 PM when reports of a "freaking metal monster" tearing through the slums began flooding in. Witnesses described the cyberpsycho as a towering figure, his body covered in glowing circuitry and implants. His eyes flickered like neon signs, and his movements were faster than anything human—or alive, for that matter. He left bodies scattered across the docks, each with a neat hole where their hearts used to be.  

>"I’ve seen some messed-up stuff in my time," one survivor, "Gustie Moore," told me, her voice trembling. **"But this? This was pure chaos. It felt like he was laughing at us, like he enjoyed every second of it."**  

The Wired Wraith wasn’t just destroying lives—he was making a statement. He targeted civilians, mercs, and even a few unlucky CircuitBreak agents sent to contain him. The city’s elite were on edge, fearing this could spill into the Upper Levels.  

Eventually, the chaos came to an end—thanks to CircuitBreak’s sharpshooting team. They took him down with precision, but not before he managed to kill 35 people and injure over 70. The aftermath? A bloodbath that left even the toughest of us speechless.  

What’s worrying everyone is how this cyberpsycho was created in the first place. Rumors are swirling about a new batch of experimental implants gone wrong, designed by none other than TaiXing Cybernetic. If this is their doing, it could mean bad news for all of us who’ve gotten too cozy with our cyberwear.

**Additional Notes Found on Terminal:**  
- The attack was linked to a batch of faulty implants distributed by TaiXing Cybernetic.  
- CircuitBreak’s involvement suggests they’re building their own hitman division, separate from the ACPD.  
- Survivors reported seeing the Wired Wraith targeting people with specific types of cyberware, hinting at a deeper motive or glitch in his programming.
