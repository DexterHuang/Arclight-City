*You crouch behind a stack of crates, your breath steady as you scan the dimly lit room. The air is thick with the smell of sweat and burning electronics. Your team is across the room, engaged in a firefight with the enemy gang. You glance at the terminal on the far wall, its screen flickering faintly. Curiosity piques, and you motion for one of your crew to check it while you cover them from the shadows.*

**Date:** 2085/08/24  
**Location:** Arclight City Underground

*You've heard whispers about him—rumors that float through the mercenary circuits like a virus. They call him "V," a ghost in the shadows, a man with no past and no face. But tonight, you found this encrypted report on a terminal in a hostile stronghold. The document is labeled simply: **"The Deed of V."**

**Date of Operation:** 2085/07/15  

*The report details a hit so audacious, it left even the most seasoned mercenaries shaking their heads. V was hired to eliminate a high-profile corporate convoy guarded by Trauma Team's elite squad. The operation unfolded in broad daylight, on a crowded highway. V's crew wasn't just any group—they were a killing machine, each member a specialist in their field. They took down the convoy in under five minutes, leaving no survivors. But it wasn’t just the efficiency that震惊ed the underworld; it was the ruthlessness. Every guard was executed with precision, and every body bore the mark of V's signature weapon: a custom plasma cutter that left incinerated corpses with the words "FOR HIRE" etched into their remains.*

**Mission Code:** RED FANG-4891  
**Target:** A rival gang leader in the Ghetto Sector  
**Date of Operation:** 2085/08/12  

*This one was even more brazen. V took out a notorious gang boss who’d been terrorizing the slums for years. The hit happened during a live broadcast, and the footage went viral. In the video, V stands in the ruins of the gang's compound, blood smeared across his visor. He delivers a cryptic message to the camera: "Greed has no place in this city. Those who prey on the weak will always be cut down." The sheer audacity of it left even the most jaded mercenaries speechless.*

> **Conclusion:**  
The report ends with a note from the finder, someone named Rubina Lee—a name that doesn’t ring any bells. She writes:  

*"I found this file in the aftermath of V’s latest hit. I couldn’t help but wonder—what kind of person would hire him? Who has that kind of power and that kind of darkness in their soul? If you’re reading this, maybe you’re one of them. But be warned—if you ever cross paths with V, there’s no coming back from it."*

> **End of File**  

*The document is unsigned, but the paranoia seeps through every word. Rubina Lee could have been a mercenary, a journalist, or even a Black Market trader. Regardless, her words linger long after you finish reading: "If you ever cross paths with V..."*

*You close the terminal, your mind racing. The legend of V is real—and if anyone in this city has crossed him, they’re already gone.*
