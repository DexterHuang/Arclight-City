*As you were exploring the gang stronghold, you stumbled upon a decrepit terminal hidden behind a stack of crates. The screen flickered faintly, casting an eerie glow on the walls. You approached it out of curiosity, noticing the cursor blinking sluggishly. A file icon caught your eye, and upon clicking, a grainy video feed began to play.*

**[Underground Augmentation Clinic Tragedy]**

*The video starts with a dimly lit room filled with outdated medical equipment. The camera pans across a blood-streaked table and various jars of mysterious fluids. A young woman in her late twenties, Krysta Jones, sits on the edge of a bed, her face a mix of fear and determination.*

**Krysta Jones**: "I did what I had to do... I wanted to make something of myself. In Arclight City, you either stand out or get trampled. I chose this clinic because it was cheap, but they promised me the world."

*The camera shifts to a close-up of her arm, which is covered in faint scars and burn marks. She flexes it slightly, revealing a glowing implant that pulses with an eerie blue light.*

**Krysta Jones**: "They said it was a simple procedure—a neural enhancer to boost my reflexes. But when they opened me up... I don't even know what happened. It wasn't just the implant; it was like they tore something out of me."

*The video cuts to footage of a surgery gone wrong. The screen shows a masked surgeon holding a smoking tool, their movements erratic and unsteady. The camera shakes as if caught in the chaos. A scream echoes through the room.*

**Krysta Jones**: "I thought I was dying... but then it stopped. They told me I’d never be the same again. And they were right."

*The video ends with a close-up of Krysta’s eyes, wild and unblinking, as if she’s staring into the abyss.*

*The file date is marked as 2081/11/3, just three days before your current discovery. The terminal also contains a note:*

`> "Desperate times call for desperate measures. This was her only chance. - Dr. Elara Voss, BioSyn Industries"`

*You wonder if this is the work of one of the mega-corps cleaning up their mess or another botched job by the Black Market. Either way, Krysta’s story serves as a grim reminder of the risks people take in pursuit of the "Arclight-dream."*
