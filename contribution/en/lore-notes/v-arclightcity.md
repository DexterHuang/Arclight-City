*You crouch behind a stack of crates, your eyes scanning the dimly lit warehouse. The air is thick with the smell of oil and rust. Suddenly, you notice an old terminal sitting on a metal desk, its screen flickering faintly. Curiosity piqued, you step closer to take a look.*

> *`Hey there, if you're reading this, chances are you've stumbled into some serious territory. My name's Audra Johnson, and I'm just a local who happened to be in the wrong place at the wrong time. But hey, that's the life in Arclight City, right?`*  
>  
> *`So, here's the deal: There's this mercenary, or maybe I should call them "V." You know those legends you hear about—some ghost who shows up out of nowhere to clean up a job and vanish just as quick? Well, V is one of 'em. They're like a myth, walking, talking. No one knows their real name, no one's ever seen their face without the mask. But what they do... oh boy, that's where it gets eerie.`*  
>  
> *`A few days ago, I was doing some digging for Hana—yeah, the Vtuber who makes crime stories look like a stroll in the park. We were looking into this heist at MegaEstate's main branch. You know how they rip people off? Well, someone finally decided to rip them back. A clean job, no survivors. Just blood and chaos, and then... silence. The cops are on high alert, but V just vanished like a ghost.`*  
>  
> *`I'm telling you, this isn't some random mercenary. This is someone who knows what they're doing, and they're not playing games. If you see 'em, don't try to follow. Just... stay off their radar.`*

*The terminal falls silent, its screen going dark as you step back. You can't shake the feeling that this "V" isn't just another mercenary—they’re something else entirely, a shadow in the system that no one dares to name. And now, they've left their mark on Arclight City.*
