*You crouch behind a stack of crates, your breath steady as you scan the dimly lit room. The air is thick with the stench of sweat and blood, and the faint hum of distant sirens echoes through the walls. You’ve been in enough fights to know better than to trust the silence.*

**> FILE NAME: V'S LEGACY  
> DATE: 2086/9/2**

---

*You approach an old terminal on the far wall, its screen flickering with static. The cursor blinks slowly, taunting you. You hesitate for a moment before reaching out to touch the cold metal surface. A faint hum emanates from it as the screen lights up, revealing a file titled "V".*

---

*The document is encrypted, but you’ve hacked enough systems to know how to bypass this. Your fingers fly across your cyberdeck, and moments later, the text unfurls on the terminal’s screen.*

**THE MYSTERY OF V**

*Who is V?*

That’s the question echoing through the mercenary community. A shadowy figure known only by the single letter “V,” this enigmatic freelancer has left a trail of bodies in their wake—or rather, a lack thereof. No one has ever seen V face-to-face, let alone captured them on tape. Their identity is as elusive as their methods.

---

*But what makes V truly legendary isn’t just their anonymity—it’s the sheer scale of their operations.*

**OPERATION: NIGHTHAWK  
> DATE: 2085/12/15**

- *Target: The Red Scorpions gang, a notorious outfit controlling half of CyberSafari District.*  
- *Casualties: 47 confirmed, with rumors of up to 63.*  
- *Methodology: V used a combination of high-altitude drones and ground forces, decimating the gang’s leadership in one fell swoop. The Red Scorpions’ territory was seized within 12 hours.*

---

**OPERATION: CAGE CLEANER  
> DATE: 2086/1/3**

- *Target: A rival mercenary crew known as the Iron Hand.*  
- *Casualties: 17, all executed with precision. No survivors.*  
- *Outcome: The Iron Hand’s leader, a man known as “The Butcher,” was found in pieces outside the Red Bar—his cybernetic enhancements fried, his body reduced to little more than scraps.*

---

*These aren’t just random hits. V operates with surgical precision, leaving cryptic messages at every kill site. Among their victims, they’ve left notes like “You shouldn’t have crossed me” and “It’s not about money—it’s about respect.”*

---

*The mercenary community is divided. Some fear V as a potential threat to their operations, while others speculate that V could be the next big thing in high-tier merc work—someone willing to take on jobs no one else dares to touch.*

---

*But why? What drives someone like V? Are they a lone wolf, or part of a larger operation?*

---

**THE SEARCH FOR V**

*The Church of the Singularity has taken an interest in V’s operations, theorizing that V could be an early adopter of synthetic consciousness—or even a fully uploaded entity. Meanwhile, the ACPD has issued a bounty for V’s head, framing them as a cyberpsycho. But those close to the mercenary world know better.*

---

*The truth is, V isn’t just another mercenary. They’re a phenomenon—a ghost in the system who leaves devastation in their wake. And if you’re reading this, chances are, someone has hired V to take you down.*

---

*You lean back from the terminal, your mind racing. The report is chilling, and you can’t help but wonder—what would drive someone to become V? And why would they target you?*

*As you pocket the file, you realize this could be your ticket to fame—or your death warrant. Either way, it’s time to decide: are you ready to face the legend of V?*
