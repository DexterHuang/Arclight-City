**Mysterious Mercenary Report**

*File Name: "The Legend of V"*

*Access Level: Restricted - For Eyes Only*

---

**Subject:** V  
**Alias:** The Phantom Executioner  
**Status:** Active ( rumored to be)  

---

V is a name that strikes fear into the hearts of even the most hardened mercenaries in Arclight City. A ghostly figure who operates with precision and efficiency, leaving no trace behind—save for the bodies of their enemies.

What do we know about V? Not much. But what little we have paints a chilling picture.

---

**Early Days:**  
V first appeared five years ago during a mercenary raid on the **Red Bar**, a hotspot for contractors. Eyewitnesses claim they were a lone wolf, taking down an entire crew with brutal efficiency. Since then, V has been popping up in the most unexpected places—hitmen for hire, corporate clean-up crews, and even freelance jobs.

---

**Signature Style:**  
V doesn’t play by the usual rules. They leave no survivors, and their methods are... unique. Reports from those who’ve crossed paths with V describe:

- *A preference for close combat over ranged weapons.*  
- *Implants that glow faintly in the dark—like a digital predator.*  
- *An eerie calmness, as if they’re already gone before you see them.*

**Notable Operations:**  

1. **The Red Bar Massacre (2082):** V single-handedly annihilated an entire mercenary crew known for their brutal tactics. No one saw it coming—or leaving.  
2. **The CircuitBreak Heist (2083):** V took down a high-profile hitman team hired by CircuitBreak, leaving behind only blood and bullet casings.  
3. **The Trauma Team Incident (2085):** A week ago, V was spotted near the Trauma Tower, where they reportedly "accidentally" caused a medical records breach—exposing some *very* high-profile clients.  

---

**Who’s Hiring V?**  
The real question is: who would pay for such a high-risk contractor? The usual suspects include the **Church of the Singularity**, the **Black Market**, or even **CircuitBreak** themselves. But nothing concrete has been proven.

What’s clear is that V isn’t just another mercenary—they’re a game-changer. And with the city’s crime rate spiraling out of control, the demand for someone like V is only going to grow.

*You wonder who could be behind such a report. Maybe it’s from a rival mercenary trying to warn others—or maybe it’s a recruitment effort.*  

*The terminal hums softly as you step back, your mind racing with questions. Who is V? And why are they here in this gang’s territory?*
