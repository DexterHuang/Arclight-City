*You crouch behind a pile of crates, your eyes scanning the dimly lit room. The air is thick with the stench of sweat and blood. You’ve just stumbled upon an old terminal, its cracked screen flickering faintly. Out of curiosity, you decide to check what’s on it.*

**Mysterious Mercenary Report**

*The terminal hums softly as you tap a few keys. A file titled "V" pops up on the screen.*

> **File Name:** V  
> **Access Level:** Restricted  
> **Date:** 2083/4/26

---

> "Legend has it, 'V' is the most elusive mercenary in all of Arclight City. A ghost in the shadows, they’ve pulled off some of the most audacious heists in recent memory. But no one knows their real identity—or even their gender."

---

> **Deeds:**  
> - *The Red Zone Heist:* Infiltrated a heavily guarded MegaEstate compound, stealing sensitive data on their corrupt real estate practices. Left before the ACPD could arrive, leaving no trace behind.  
> - *The Church Incident:* Disrupted a Pachinko Cult ritual at the heart of Data Oasis District. Survivors say they moved like a ghost, taking out guards with precision and vanishing into thin air.  
> - *Trauma Team Takedown:* Raided one of their secret clinics, freeing hostages who had been experimented on without consent. Left behind a single bloodstained glove as a calling card.

---

> **Speculation:**  
> Who could afford such high-tier mercenary work? The CircuitBreak hitmen? Maybe, but they usually operate in teams. Some whisper it’s the Church of the Singularity funding them—trying to create the ultimate AI by any means necessary. Others say it’s BioSyn Industries, testing their own cybernetic soldiers.  
> Whatever the truth, one thing is clear: *V* isn’t just a mercenary—they’re a game-changer.

---

> **Warning:**  
> The ACPD has put out a bounty for this "cyberpsycho." But don’t be fooled—this isn’t about justice. They’re scared of what *V* represents. If you see them, run. Unless you want to end up in the same fate as their targets.

*The screen flickers one last time before going dark. You stand there, staring at the terminal, wondering if this is just another rumor or something more. The city’s full of mysteries, but *V* might be its biggest enigma.*
