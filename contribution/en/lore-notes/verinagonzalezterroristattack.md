*You found an old journal lying on a dusty shelf in the gang’s stronghold. The cover is worn, with faint scuffs and a dried tear stain on the front. As you flip it open, you see the words “Verina Gonzalez” written in shaky handwriting.*

> Today was supposed to be just another day. I never thought something like this would happen. My whole life changed in an instant.
>
> They said it was a terrorist attack on the CircuitBreak HQ tower. I didn’t believe it at first—I mean, who would target one of the biggest megacorps? But then the news started filtering through the streets. People were talking about a black-market thermal nuke, something only the most ruthless cybersmugglers could get their hands on.
>
> I remember hearing the explosion from my apartment in the slums. It felt like the ground shook beneath my feet. I ran to the window, and there it was—this massive mushroom cloud rising into the sky, casting an eerie glow over everything. The air was thick with ash, and the smell of burning metal lingered for days.
>
> They rebuilt the tower, but it’s not the same. It’s bigger now, more fortified, like they’re trying to erase what happened. But I can’t forget. My family… my *ohana*… we were in the city that day. My mom was working at a nearby clinic, and my little brother was with her. They didn’t make it.
>
> The government says it’s all under control now, that the terrorists were just freelancers with no real connection. But I know better. There’s something they’re hiding. CircuitBreak has always been shady, but this… this goes too deep.
>
> I’ve spent every day since searching for answers, piecing together fragments of what happened. I’ve talked to survivors, hackers, and even a few whistleblowers. They all say the same thing: it wasn’t just a random attack. It was *targeted*. And who benefits from that? The ones in power.
>
> I’m not alone in this. There are others—people like Camden Evans and Rayshell Moore—who lost their families too. We’re scattered, but we’re determined to find the truth. No matter what it takes.
>
> **Verina Gonzalez**  
> *A mother turned investigator, seeking justice for her lost ohana.*

*As you read through the diary, you feel a heavy weight in your chest. The city’s darkness seems even more oppressive now.*
