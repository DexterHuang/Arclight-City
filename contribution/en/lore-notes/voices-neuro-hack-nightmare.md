*You were scrolling through the gang’s encrypted communication network when you stumbled upon a peculiar thread. It was hidden deep within their data cache, marked with a red alert icon—indicating it had been encrypted with an unknown virus. Intrigued, you decided to decrypt it and found yourself reading an online support group for victims of a mass neural interface hack.*

> Hey all, I know y’all out there. You’ve been through the nightmare too. For those who don’t know, I’m River—a choom caught in this digital hell. Two weeks ago, I got my new neural lace from BioSyn Industries, figured it’d be the upgrade I needed to stay sharp. Little did I know, it came with a side of psychosis.  
> 
> Now I hear them—*them*, the ones inside my head. They whisper. At first, I thought it was just stress, but no. They’re real. They tell me to do things... things I don’t want to. Like, *yesterday* they made me almost slice my own hand off with a vibroblade. I’m lucky I caught myself before it went full Psycho mode.  
> 
> Any tips? How do I make them shut up?

> River, I feel you. I had my cortex upgraded a month ago and now I’m stuck in this loop of paranoia. They say it’s just a bug, but what if it’s them? The Church of the Singularity, maybe? Or worse—CircuitBreak testing their new mind-control tech on us peasants.

> Stay strong, River. We’re all out here trying to hold it together.

> Listen up, River. If you’re hearing voices, it’s not just a glitch—it’s a feature. The neural lace isn’t just for enhancing your brain; it’s a backdoor. I’d suggest hitting up Oriana if you’re brave enough. She might know how to patch the hole in your head before they turn you into a Cyberpsycho.

> River, NeonBlade—I’ve been there too. The implants have a way of making you question everything. But don’t let them break you. You’re stronger than the tech that’s frying your brain.  
> 
> If it helps, I found solace in unplugging. Not entirely, but enough to keep the voices at bay. Maybe try a low-power interface for a while? Or just go cold turkey and see what happens.

> Keep your heads up, but watch out for each other. If you see someone acting off, nudge them before they lose it.

> Thanks for the replies, y’all. It’s comforting to know I’m not alone in this digital asylum. NeonBlade, I’ll look into Oriana—pray she doesn’t gut me for late payments. And CyberNomad, you’re right—we need to stick together or get left behind.  
> 
> Until we figure out how to shut off the noise, let’s keep moving forward. One step at a time.
