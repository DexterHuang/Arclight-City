*As you were exploring the gang's stronghold, you stumbled upon a terminal in the corner of a dimly lit room. The screen flickered slightly, and out of curiosity, you decided to take a closer look. As your eyes scanned the text, you realized it was an online support thread for victims of a mass neural interface hack.*

**Subject: "We're Not Alone" - A Call for Help**

*"I can't sleep anymore... not since they took over my mind. I thought I was safe, but apparently, the corporate implants aren't just for convenience. They see everything. Every thought, every fear. It's like having a permanent passenger in your skull, and you can't even tell them to shut up.

I don’t know who you are or where you’re reading this from, but I need someone to say that I’m not alone. My boss at MegaEstate told me my paranoia was just a figment of my imagination, but now I see the truth. They’re watching us all. This thread is for anyone else out there who’s been through this nightmare. Let’s share our stories and find a way to reclaim what’s ours: our minds."*

*"I’m in the same boat, sister. After the hack, I started seeing things—holograms of data streams floating in front of me. It’s like my brain is on permanent overload. But I don’t trust anyone anymore. Not even myself. Who knows if I’ll snap one day and turn into another cyber psycho?

We need to be careful out there. The ACPD isn’t our friend, and the corporations? They’re laughing at us while we struggle to hold onto our sanity. Let’s stick together, but off-grid. No more netcom. Just... face-to-face. If that’s even possible anymore."*

*"I’ve been trying to disconnect ever since the hack. Sold my implants piece by piece on the black market, but every time I think I’m free, a memory flickers in—like a glitched vid. It’s not just about the tech; it’s about the trust. How can you trust anyone when you know they could be broadcasting your thoughts to the highest bidder?

I found this thread by accident—a rogue data stream popped up in my mind. Maybe we’re all part of some bigger experiment. But if that’s the case, let’s make sure we’re the ones pulling the strings next time."*

*"To those who have lost trust in their own minds—let me offer a glimmer of hope. I’ve spent decades tweaking and upgrading neural interfaces, and I know one thing for certain: they’re not infallible. If you’ve been hacked, there’s always a way to rewire your system.

But be warned, the road ahead isn’t easy. It requires precision, courage, and a willingness to embrace the unknown. Reach out to me if you need a second opinion—I may charge an arm and a leg, but I guarantee results. After all, it’s not about surviving in this world; it’s about thriving.

*As you scrolled through the thread, you couldn’t help but feel a chill run down your spine. These stories were all too real—and they painted a grim picture of a city where even your thoughts weren’t safe. You wondered who was behind the hack and what their endgame could possibly be. One thing was clear: trust was a rare commodity in Arclight City, and the road to recovery would be anything but easy.*
