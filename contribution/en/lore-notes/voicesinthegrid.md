*You stumbled upon an old terminal in the corner of the gang’s stronghold. The screen flickers to life as you approach, revealing a log from an Augmented Reality Addiction Support Group meeting. The words are潦草but telling.*

> **AR Addiction Support Group Log**  
> *Date: 2082/12/18*  
> *Facilitator: Debor Campbell*  

**Debor**: "Welcome back, everyone. Let’s take a deep breath and remember—this space is for you to share your stories without judgment. Whether you’re seeing more than the rest of us or just can’t tell if that glowing orb is real or your implant messing with your head, we’re here for it."

---

*The screen flickers as a distorted face appears.*  

**Hana**: "Hi there! I’m Hana, still your girl reporting from the front lines of AR chaos. You know, I was covering this gang fight yesterday, and my visor decided to merge the battlefield with my Vtuber streams. Now I’m not sure if that ‘Sunny Sparkles’ filter is enhancing reality or if the city’s actually turning pastel. My catchphrases are starting to feel more like prophecies!"

**Debor**: "Laughter’s a good sign, Hana. But let’s keep it real—how many of you felt your implants glitch today?"

*The room falls silent before a voice cracks through.*  

**Alex**: "I… I think I became a cyberpsycho for a second there. My chips were flashing red, and I swear I saw enemies everywhere. Next thing I know, I’m on the floor with Oriana’s wrench in my face, yelling about how I tried to ‘rip out her code.’ Trauma Team showed up, but they wouldn’t save me unless I signed their insurance forms first."

**Debor**: "Ouch. Alex, you’re not alone—many of us struggle with that edge. What’s keeping you grounded?"

**Mia**: "I got my VR blocker now. It helps, but the world feels so… dull without the filters. My neon glow is part of me now. I’m half-tempted to go back to the Black Market and upgrade it further."

---

*The screen flickers again, showing a darker corner of the room.*  

**Ethan**: "I don’t even know if my daughter’s face I saw last night was real or another datasim flashback. She looked so… different from how she did in my implants. Did I lose her? Or is it just that AR can’t replace family?"

*The group falls silent, the weight of Ethan’s words hanging in the air.*  

**Debor**: "Ethan, we’re all here to remind each other that we’re more than our chips and wires. You’ve got this."

---

*The log cuts off there, leaving you wondering how many stories went untold. The terminal hums softly as if processing the chaos it just revealed.*

--- 

*You close the terminal, the words lingering in your mind like a datasim you can’t shake.*
