*You crouch behind a stack of crates, your breath shaky as you scan the dimly lit room. The air is thick with the smell of oil and burnt electronics. Scattered across the floor are broken monitors, tangled wires, and discarded cyberwear parts. Your eyes flicker over a terminal sitting on a rusted desk, its screen flickering faintly. Curiosity gets the better of you, and you step closer, your boots clanking softly against the cold metal floor.*

> **Subject: VR Dating Fail**

> To whoever might stumble upon this,
>
> Let me start by saying that I’m not even sure why I agreed to this in the first place. Some friend—okay, “choomba”—dragged me into this VR dating thing. Apparently, it’s the latest trend among the cyber-snob crowd. They said it was “glitch-free” and “totally secure,” which coming from them probably means they hacked some corporate system to get the invite.
>
> So there I am, sitting in some dive bar off the Grid, sipping my synthwave tea—yeah, that’s a thing—and putting on this VR headset. It felt like stepping into a neon-lit paradise, but you know what? That’s when it all went south.
>
> My avatar was supposed to be this sleek, AI-generated masterpiece. Instead, I looked like a walking glitch effect. My legs were two separate animations, one trying to move forward while the other did a little jig. And my arms? Don’t even get me started on the arms. They were like a game of tug-of-war, pulling in opposite directions.
>
> To make it worse, every time I tried to talk, my voice distorted into this demonic wail that made the bar patrons cringe and reach for their weapons. I didn’t know whether to laugh or scream. Probably both.
>
> Then there was the date itself. My “date” showed up as a giant floating orb with legs—some kind of VR glitch where they tried too hard to make it look cool, I guess. It started quoting lines from old romance movies, but every third word was just static. Classic Zero Byte vibes, if you ask me.
>
> I tried to escape by hacking the system—what else am I supposed to do? But apparently, even my implants decided to malfunction. My cyber-eyes glitched, turning everything into a kaleidoscope of colors, and my neural link froze mid-hack. Talk about a bad trip.
>
> By the time I managed to get out of that VR nightmare, I was lucky to find this terminal lying around. I figured it’s better than facing another round of “date hell.”
>
> So if you’re reading this, maybe we’re both in too deep. At least know that you’re not alone in the struggle.

*As you read through the message, a faint chuckle escapes your lips. You can almost picture the hapless individual trying to navigate their VR disaster, only to be met with endless glitches and chaos. The note leaves you wondering: would you survive a date in this world? Probably not.*
