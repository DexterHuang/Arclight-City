*As you were exploring the gang's stronghold, you stumbled upon an old terminal tucked away in a corner room. Curiosity piqued, you decided to give it a closer look. The screen flickered to life, revealing a series of messages and logs.*

> **Subject:** Virtual Reality Dating Disaster  
> **Date:** 2081/1/25  
> **From:** Gerrie Hill  

*You found an unlocked laptop with a file on the desktop.*  

`> "OMG, this is going to be so fun! I finally got my hands on the latest VR dating sim! It's supposed to be the ultimate in immersive experiences. I can't wait to meet my perfect match!" – Gerrie's excited voice clip plays as static interference interrupts her enthusiasm.*

**Message 1:**  
`> "Alright, let's do this. My avatar is ready—pink hair, neon eyes, and a killer outfit! Who needs real-life when you can be a walking synth in VR? ;)"`  

*The screen flickers, displaying a glitched image of a female avatar with mismatched limbs and pixelated features.*  

**Message 2:**  
`> "Okay, weirdo. You there? The system said someone was nearby… Wait, are you even real or just another bot?"`  

*A distorted voice responds:*  

```*static crackles*  
**Unknown Voice:** "I am real, I assure you. My name is... uh... something starting with 'L'. Let's call it Lumi."  
```  

**Message 3:**  
`> "Haha, funny! So, what do you like? Cats? Dogs? Cyberware? Wait, why are your arms turning into noodles?!"`  

*The screen shows a comically glitching avatar with spaghetti-like limbs flailing uncontrollably.*  

**Message 4:**  
`> "This is NOT funny! What did I do wrong? Did I download the patch correctly? Why am I getting static?"`  

```*static crackles again*  
**Unknown Voice:** "Uh... your VR suit is malfunctioning. The neural link is... uh, not connecting properly."  
```  

**Message 5:**  
`> "Oh my Goddess of Pachinko, this is a disaster! I thought VR was supposed to be immersive, not this messed up!"`  

*The screen freezes for a moment before flickering back to life. A new message appears.*  

---

**Final Message:**  
`> "I'm never using VR dating again. If the Church of Pachinko thinks this is my destiny, they can keep their gambling nonsense. I’m sticking to meatspace where at least I don’t look like a glitching synth!"`  

*The terminal goes dark as you close it, leaving behind a faint whiff of burnt circuitry and the echo of Gerrie’s laughter turning into a scream of terror.*
