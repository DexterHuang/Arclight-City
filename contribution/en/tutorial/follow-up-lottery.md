## What is the Follow-Up Lottery?
The Follow-Up Lottery is a special loot draw where you're guaranteed to win your chosen prize. Select a rare item as your **Prime Target**, and with each roll, your chances of winning it increase until it's yours!

## How do I play the Follow-Up Lottery?
1. **Choose Your Prize:** Pick a **Prime Target** from the list to lock it in. 
2. **Roll for Loot:** Tap **ROLL** to try for your Prime Target and also get other normal rewards.
3. **Better Odds, Every Time:** If you don't win the Prime Target on a roll, your progress advances to the next tier, boosting your chances for the next one!
4. **Guaranteed Win:** Your odds will continue to climb with each tier until you secure the Prime Target. It's a matter of when, not if.
