## What is the Follow-Up Lottery?
The Follow-Up Lottery is a special loot draw where you're guaranteed to win your chosen prize. Select a rare item as your **Prime Target**, and with each roll, your chances of winning it increase until it's yours!

## How do I play the Follow-Up Lottery?
1. **Choose Your Prize:** Pick a **Prime Target** from the list to lock it in. 
2. **Roll for Loot:** Tap **ROLL** to try for your Prime Target and also get other normal rewards.
3. **Better Odds, Every Time:** If you don't win the Prime Target on a roll, your progress advances to the next tier, boosting your chances for the next one!
4. **Guaranteed Win:** Your odds will continue to climb with each tier until you secure the Prime Target. It's a matter of when, not if.

## Do I always get a reward in the Follow-Up Lottery?
Yes! Every time you roll, you are guaranteed to receive a normal reward from the loot table, even if you don't win the Prime Target. So you're always getting something valuable for each attempt.

## How do Tiers work in the Follow-Up Lottery?
Think of tiers as leveling up your luck. Every time a roll doesn't grant the Prime Target, you move to a higher tier. Each new tier makes it significantly more likely you'll win on the next attempt. The roll cost adjusts with each tier, but your improved odds bring you much closer to your goal.

## Where can I see the Follow-Up Lottery chances?
With full transparency, all probabilities and cost for each tier for prime target and normal rewards are displayed clearly in-game. Just tap the information icon on the lottery screen for a full breakdown of your current odds.

## What happens when the Follow-Up Lottery resets?
The lottery page **resets** when the timer expires. If you haven't won your prize by then, your current tier progress and chosen Prime Target will also **reset**. You can then select a new Prime Target again.

## Can I change my Prime Target in the Follow-Up Lottery?
Once you've locked in your **Prime Target**, it stays fixed until one of two events occur:
1. **You win the Prime Target:** Congratulations, the hunt is over and you may pick a new target next time.
2. **Reset Timer Expires:** When the timer expires, the lottery resets and you can choose a new Prime Target.

Choose wisely before locking in your Prime Target!
