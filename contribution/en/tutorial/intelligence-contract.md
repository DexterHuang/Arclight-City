## What are Intelligence Contracts?

Intelligence Contracts are weekly missions that provide challenging objectives with substantial rewards. These contracts reset every week based on Arclight City's dynamic geopolitical situation, offering fresh scenarios and story-driven content each time.

## How do Intelligence Contracts work?

All Intelligence Contracts require you to collect **Data Cores**. Once you accept a contract, you'll need to gather the required Data Cores and submit them to complete the mission. Each contract comes with a story that provides context for your mission.

## How do I obtain Data Cores?

You can collect **Data Cores** primarily through **Hideout Raids**. These quick raids on gang hideouts will reward you with Data Cores along with other valuable loot. Make sure you have either a Hideout Locator or Advanced Hideout Locator to perform these raids.

## When do Intelligence Contracts reset?

Intelligence Contracts reset every **Monday**, providing you with fresh missions and new stories each week. Any unfinished contracts from the previous week will be replaced with new ones.

## How do I accept an Intelligence Contract?

1. Navigate to the Intelligence Contracts page from the main menu.
2. Review the available contract tiers and their stories.
3. Choose the contract tier that matches your budget and desired rewards.
4. Accept the contract.
5. The contract will be automatically pinned to your quest list.

## Can I have multiple Intelligence Contracts active?

Yes, you can have multiple Intelligence Contracts active at a time.

## What happens if I don't complete my contract before the reset?

Intelligence Contracts have **deadlines**. When you accept a contract, you have **7 days** from the acceptance time to complete it. If you don't complete your contract within 7 days of accepting it, the contract will be deemed as failed and automatically removed from your quest list.

**Note**: The 7-day deadline is independent of the weekly reset schedule. This means you have a full week to complete your contract regardless of when you accept it during the week.

## Any tips for Intelligence Contracts?

- **Start with Standard**: If you're new to Intelligence Contracts, begin with the free Standard tier to familiarize yourself with the mechanics.
- **Plan your week**: Since contracts reset weekly, plan your Data Core collection early in the week.
- **Stock up on Locators**: Keep Hideout Locators in your inventory to ensure you can always perform raids when needed.
