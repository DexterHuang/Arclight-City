## What are Investigations?

**Investigations** are detective cases where you solve cybercrime mysteries by collecting clues and identifying the culprit. Each case presents a unique cyberpunk crime story set in Arclight City, where you'll gather evidence and make your final verdict to crack the case.

## Where can I access Investigations?

You can view your active investigation from the `Investigations` tab on the Quest Page. You'll also see an overview of all cases you've solved in the past.

## How do I start an investigation?

Investigations begin automatically when you collect your first clue. There's no need to manually start a case - simply find an **investigation point** in a Stronghold and interact with it to collect evidence.

## Where do I find investigation points?

Investigation points appear as special tiles in Strongholds. When you explore Strongholds and encounter these marked locations, you can interact with them to collect clues for your active case.

## How many clues are in each case?

Every investigation case contains **exactly 4 clues**. You must collect all four clues before you can submit your verdict and solve the case.

## What happens when I collect a clue?

When you collect a clue, you'll receive:

- The **clue content** - detailed evidence related to the case
- An **evidence image** - visual documentation of the clue
- A **progress update** - showing how many clues you've collected (e.g., 2/4)

If this is your **first clue**, you'll also receive the **case introduction** that sets up the mystery and provides context for your investigation.

## What is the case summary?

As you collect clues, the case summary updates to reflect your current progress. This summary helps you piece together the evidence and understand what you've discovered so far. The summary changes after each new clue you collect, giving you an evolving picture of the case.

## Can I work on multiple cases at once?

No, you can only have **one active investigation** at a time. Once you start a case by collecting your first clue, you must either solve it or abandon it before starting a new one.

## How do I solve a case?

Once you've collected all 4 clues:

1. Navigate to the `Investigations` tab on the Quest Page
2. Review all your collected evidence and the case summary
3. Tap the `DELIVER YOUR VERDICT` button
4. You'll be presented with **4 possible conclusions** in a swipeable carousel
5. Swipe through the options and read each verdict carefully
6. Select the conclusion you believe is correct
7. Tap `SUBMIT VERDICT` to lock in your choice

## What do I need to submit a verdict?

To submit your verdict, you need an **Investigation Access Permit**. This permit is consumed when you submit your answer, regardless of whether your verdict is correct or incorrect.

## Where do I get Investigation Access Permits?

Investigation Access Permits can be found in **Stronghold chests**. Keep exploring Strongholds to collect these permits for future investigations.

## What happens if I choose the wrong verdict?

If your verdict is incorrect:

- The case is cleared from your active investigation slot
- You **lose the Investigation Access Permit** you used to submit
- All collected clues are cleared
- You may encounter the same case again in the future when exploring Strongholds
- You'll receive a new case (could be the same one or a different one) when you collect your next clue

Choose carefully before submitting your verdict!

## What happens if I choose the correct verdict?

You'll receive the **full story** revealing what happened, earn **rewards** (Eurodollars, experience, items), and the case is marked as **solved** for viewing later in the Solved Mysteries page.

## Can I abandon an investigation?

Yes, you can abandon your current investigation at any time by tapping the trash icon in the top-right corner of your active investigation.

## Where can I view my solved cases?

You can view all your previously solved cases on the **Solved Mysteries** page. Access it from the navigation menu to review case details, read the full stories, and see when you solved each mystery.

## Can I review clues before submitting my verdict?

Yes! In your active investigation view, you can tap on any collected clue to see its full details again, including the clue content and evidence image. This helps you review all the evidence before making your final decision.
