## What is NetRun?

**NetRun** is a weekly cooperative operation where you and your gang work together to breach megacorporation security systems. Each week features a different target corporation with unique briefings and objectives. By completing breaches, you contribute points toward shared goals and earn valuable rewards.

## Where can I find NetRun?

You can access NetRun through a specific NPC in the city. Look for the `Access NetRun Operations` option to enter the operation dashboard.

## What do I need to participate?

To participate in NetRun operations, you need:

- **Gang membership**: You must be part of a gang. Solo players cannot participate in NetRun operations.
- **Breach Module**: A consumable item required for each breach attempt. The module is consumed regardless of whether you succeed or fail.

## How do I start a breach?

1. Access the NetRun page via the `Access NetRun Operations` option.
2. Review the current operation briefing and target corporation.
3. Tap the `INITIATE BREACH` button.
4. Complete the Node Linker puzzle within the time limit.

## How does the Node Linker puzzle work?

The **Node Linker** is a connection puzzle where you route power from a start point to an end point:

- You're presented with a grid of rotatable nodes (pipes).
- The **IN** marker shows where power enters, and the **OUT** marker shows where it needs to reach.
- Tap any node to rotate it 90 degrees.
- Nodes glow green when they're connected to the power source.
- You have **60 seconds** to complete the connection.
- **Start and end nodes are locked** and cannot be rotated.

If you successfully connect IN to OUT, you earn contribution points. If time runs out before completing the connection, the breach fails and your Breach Module is lost without earning points.

## What happens if I fail a breach?

Your **Breach Module is consumed** even if you fail. You won't earn any points for a failed breach, but you can try again if you have more Breach Modules.

## How do I get Breach Modules?

If you don't have any Breach Modules, tapping `INITIATE BREACH` will show you where to obtain them. They can be acquired through various in-game activities and rewards.

## What are Personal Objectives?

**Personal Objectives** are individual milestones based on your total contribution points during the operation. There are multiple tiers of objectives, each requiring progressively more points.

When you reach a point threshold, the objective becomes claimable. Tap on a completed objective to claim your rewards.

## What are Global Milestones?

**Global Milestones** are collective goals that unlock when everyone's combined contributions reach certain thresholds. You can see milestone markers on the progress bar.

**Important**: You can only claim Global Milestone rewards after completing **all Personal Objectives**. Even if the global progress is complete, you won't be able to claim milestone rewards until you've contributed enough points to complete your personal objectives.

## How do the leaderboards work?

The `OBJECTIVES` tab shows two leaderboards:

- **Players**: Individual contributors ranked by total points
- **Gangs**: Gangs ranked by their members' combined contributions

Tap on any player or gang name to view their profile.

## How long does each operation last?

Each NetRun operation runs for **one week**. The countdown timer in the header shows how much time remains before the operation ends and a new one begins.

## What is the BRIEFING tab?

The **BRIEFING** tab shows the current operation's target and mission details.

## Can I participate in multiple operations?

Each operation lasts one week and resets automatically. Your progress, contributions, and claimed rewards reset with each new operation, so make sure to claim all your earned rewards before the operation ends.
