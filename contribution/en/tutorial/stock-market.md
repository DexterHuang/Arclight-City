## What is the Stock Market?
The Stock Market is where you can invest your Eurodollars in various corporations to potentially grow your wealth through strategic trading. You can buy and sell shares of three major companies using real-time market data.

## Where can I find the Stock Market?
You can access from the cybernet menu

## How do I buy stocks?
1. Tap on any company from the Stock Exchange List
2. On the Stock Details Page, tap the **TRADE** button
3. Select the **BUY** tab in the trading modal
4. Enter the number of shares you want to purchase using the input field or slider
5. Review the transaction details including the trading fees (0.4% + 20 Eurodollar flat fee)
6. Tap **CONFIRM BUY** to complete the purchase

## How do I sell stocks?
1. Open the trading modal for a stock you own
2. Select the **SELL** tab
3. Enter the number of shares to sell (you can only sell what you own) 
4. Review the transaction details including the trading fees (0.4% + 20 Eurodollar flat fee)
5. Tap **CONFIRM SELL** to complete the sale

## What are trading fees?
All stock transactions incur **two types of fees**:
- **Percentage fee**: 0.4% of the transaction value
- **Flat fee**: 20 Eurodollars per transaction

**How fees are applied**:
- **Buy orders**: Both fees are added to your total cost (stock price + 0.4% + 20 ED)
- **Sell orders**: Both fees are deducted from your proceeds (stock price - 0.4% - 20 ED)
- All fees are automatically calculated and shown before you confirm any trade

**Example**: Trading 10,000 ED worth of stock incurs 40 ED (0.4%) + 20 ED (flat) = 60 ED total fees

## How are stock price determined?
The in game stock market tracks the real world stock market and combines multiple undisclosed real tickers to create a dynamic and unpredictable market.
this is done so that people will not be able to manipulate the market by buying or selling large amounts of stocks, similar to how the real world stock market works; your purchase or sell orders will not be able to move the price of the stock (assuming you are not a multi-billionaire)

## How are the sell and purchase prices determined?
the price is calculated in realtime from the real world stock market tickers, due to network latency, spread and other factors, the price you see on your screen may differ slightly from the actual market price you will purchase or sell at

## How often do stock prices update?
The stock chart is updated every **5 minutes** during normal trading. 
however purchases and sales are realtime market prices.

## Do my trades affect stock prices?
**No, your individual buy and sell orders will NOT affect the stock prices in any way.**

This is **intentional by design** for several important reasons:

**Fairness & Anti-Manipulation:**
- We want to ensure a fair trading environment for all players
- No single player or group can manipulate stock prices for their advantage
- Prevents "pump and dump" schemes or coordinated market manipulation
- Everyone trades at the same market-driven prices regardless of their wealth level

**Real-World Market Tracking:**
- Stock prices are derived from real-world market data and multiple undisclosed tickers
- This creates genuine unpredictability that cannot be gamed or predicted
- Market movements reflect actual economic events and trends, not player actions
- Ensures that success depends on market analysis skills, not market manipulation

**Equal Playing Field:**
- New players aren't disadvantaged by wealthy players controlling prices
- Trading success is based on timing and market knowledge, not financial dominance
- Maintains competitive balance across all player wealth levels

This system mirrors how real-world stock markets work for individual retail investors - unless you're trading billions, your individual orders don't move the market price.

## What is Unrealized P&L vs Realized P&L?
- **Unrealized P&L**: Your current profit/loss on stocks you still own. This changes as stock prices fluctuate and shows potential gains/losses.
- **Realized P&L**: Your actual profit/loss from completed trades. This is updated when you sell stocks and represents your permanent trading performance.

## What information can I see on the Stock Details page?
For each stock, you can view:
- Current price and daily price change
- Interactive price chart with historical data
- Your current holdings (number of shares owned)
- Average purchase price of your shares
- Current profit/loss amount and percentage
- Total market value of your position

## What should I know about market risks?
- The market tracks the real world market, so it **IS** expected to be volatile from time to time;
it can shoot to the moon or crash to the ground due to real world events, news, etc.
- I (Dexter) do not have control over the real world market, so cannot control the price of the in-game stock too.

## How can I track my portfolio performance?
Your portfolio overview shows:
- **Total Asset Value**: Current worth of all your stock holdings
- **Unrealized P&L**: Current gains/losses on active positions (green for profits, red for losses)
- **Realized P&L**: Total profit/loss from all completed trades

## What are some trading tips?
- **Diversify**: Don't put all your money in one stock
- **Monitor trends**: Use the price charts to analyze historical performance  
- **Keep cash reserves**: Maintain some Eurodollars for new opportunities
- **Start small**: Learn the market patterns before making large investments

## What happens to my stocks if I'm mugged or arrested?
When you lose a PvP encounter, your stock holdings may be at risk depending on the type of encounter:

**Arrests (Citizen's Arrest):**
- **100% chance**: The ACPD will always seize a percentage of your stock holdings when you're arrested
- **Asset forfeiture**: Seized shares are immediately liquidated and the proceeds go to the arresting player (minus PvP tax)

**Mugging:**
- **Chance-based system**: Stock theft is not guaranteed - it depends on whether the attacker successfully hacks your portfolio
- **Lower probability**: Mugging attempts have a lower chance of successful stock theft compared to arrests

**General mechanics for both:**
- **Lower loss rate**: The percentage of stocks lost is lower than your Eurodollar loss percentage
- **Rounded up losses**: If you lose fractional shares (e.g., 1.1 shares), the system rounds up to the next whole number (2 shares)
- **Immediate liquidation**: Stolen/seized shares are instantly sold at current market prices
- **Attacker receives proceeds**: The attacker gets the cash value of your liquidated stocks, minus the standard PvP tax

**Important**: Unlike Eurodollars which have a 10,000 loss cap, stock losses have no upper limit. However, the generally lower loss rates and chance-based nature (for mugging) plus that it is a more covert way to store your wealth make stocks a interesting option for wealth storage.
