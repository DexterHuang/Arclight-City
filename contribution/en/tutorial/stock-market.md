## How are stock price determined?
The in game stock market tracks the real world stock market and combines multiple undisclosed real tickers to create a dynamic and unpredictable market.
this is done so that people will not be able to manipulate the market by buying or selling large amounts of stocks, similar to how the real world stock market works; your purchase or sell orders will not be able to move the price of the stock (assuming you are not a multi-billionaire)

## How are the sell and purchase prices determined?
the price is calculated in realtime from the real world stock market tickers, due to network latency, spread and other factors, the price you see on your screen may differ slightly from the actual market price you will purchase or sell at

## How often do stock prices update?
The stock chart is updated every **5 minutes** during normal trading. 
however purchases and sales are realtime market prices.

## What is Unrealized P&L vs Realized P&L?

- **Realized P&L**: Your actual profit/loss from completed trades. This is updated when you sell stocks and represents your permanent trading performance.

## What information can I see on the Stock Details page?
For each stock, you can view:
- Current price and daily price change
- Interactive price chart with historical data
- Your current holdings (number of shares owned)
- Average purchase price of your shares
- Current profit/loss amount and percentage

## What should I know about market risks?
- The market tracks the real world market, so it **IS** expected to be volatile from time to time;
it can shoot to the moon or crash to the ground due to real world events, news, etc.
- I (Dexter) do not have control over the real world market, so cannot control the price of the in-game stock too.

## How can I track my portfolio performance?
Your portfolio overview shows:
- **Total Asset Value**: Current worth of all your stock holdings
- **Unrealized P&L**: Current gains/losses on active positions (green for profits, red for losses)
- **Realized P&L**: Total profit/loss from all completed trades
