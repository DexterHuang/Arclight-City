  "story": "You find yourself standing at the edge of a massive, dimly lit laboratory filled with rows of humming machinery and strange contraptions. The air is thick with the smell of oil and burned wiring. In the center of the lab, you spot a large, cylindrical device emitting a bright blue glow. Suddenly, you hear the sound of gears shifting and machinery whirring to life. A nearby console flickers on, displaying a countdown timer: 5 minutes until the device is primed for activation. What do you do?",
