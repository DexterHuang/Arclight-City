Subject: New Project Proposal
Date: 2080/3/15

Dear Colleagues,

I hope this email finds you well. As we discussed during our last meeting, I would like to propose a new project that could potentially benefit us all. Specifically, I suggest developing a revolutionary new type of cyberware that combines both functionalities and enhancements while being more affordable than current options available on the market.

This product would target middle-class consumers who desire advanced technological capabilities without breaking their bank accounts. By tapping into this vast consumer base, we stand to increase profits significantly across all companies involved. Furthermore, it may open doors for future collaborations and expand our reach globally.

Of course, there are challenges ahead – research & development costs must remain within budget constraints, production processes need optimization, and potential regulatory hurdles should not impede progress. However, given each company’s expertise in its respective field (medical tech/security systems/housing solutions), I believe these obstacles can be overcome successfully.

In conclusion, I urge you both to consider seriously investing resources towards this venture. Let me know your thoughts on how best we can move forward together. Thank you for taking the time to read my proposal.

Best regards,

Wei Chang
CEO | Taixing Cybernetics
