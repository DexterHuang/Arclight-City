*You found an old voice recorder on a desk. As you press play, a voice starts to speak.*

**Allis Brown**: "Hey there, Allis here. I don't know if anyone will ever hear this, but it's always good to have something to rant about, right? So, today I was working on this new implant prototype that's supposed to give you the ability to see through walls. Sounds cool, huh? Well, let me tell you, it's been a rollercoaster of a day."

*There's a pause as if Allis is taking a deep breath.*

**Allis Brown**: "First off, I had to deal with that idiot Bernita Wilson from the MegaEstate. She came in here demanding her rent money back because she slipped on some spilled netcoins and broke her fancy cyber leg. Can you believe that? Spilled netcoins, really?"

*Allis chuckles.*

**Allis Brown**: "And then there's Oriana. Don't get me wrong, she's a genius when it comes to cyberware, but she can be so unpredictable. One moment she's laughing at some stupid RipperDoc joke, and the next, she's dissecting a freshly harvested cyber arm for research purposes."

*Allis sighs.*

**Allis Brown**: "Anyway, back to my wall-seeing implant. So, I finally got it working, but then Vincent Hill decided to test it out without my permission. Next thing I know, he's running around the lab screaming about seeing ghosts and aliens in the walls. I swear, some people just don't understand the responsibility that comes with playing with cutting-edge technology."

*There's a long pause.*

**Allis Brown**: "But you know what? Despite all the craziness, I love this job. The thrill of pushing the boundaries of cybernetic innovation is like nothing else in Arclight City. So here's to another day in the life of Allis Brown, scientist extraordinaire."

*The voice recorder clicks off.*
