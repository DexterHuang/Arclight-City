You stumble upon a battered datapad lying amidst scattered gear and shattered furniture. The screen flickers erratically, displaying a fragmented video log. You manage to stabilize it, and a shaky image comes into focus – a young woman with tear-streaked face, her cybernetic eye glowing an unsettling red.

*Ally Martin coughs, her voice trembling.*
**Ally Martin**: "This… this is Ally. I don't know if anyone will ever see this. But… but I have to tell someone what happened. It started with whispers, you know? About a cyberpsycho on the loose in Sector 7. We thought it was just another rumour, another way for the gangs to scare us. But then… then the screams started."

*The footage cuts to a chaotic scene – flickering neon signs casting grotesque shadows on rain-slicked streets. Distant gunfire echoes through the alleyways.*

**Ally Martin**: "It was like something out of a nightmare. He just… appeared. Cybernetics sparking, eyes glowing red, teeth bared in a feral snarl. He moved so fast, a blur of metal and rage. People were caught off guard, didn't stand a chance." 

*The camera shakes violently as Ally ducks behind a dumpster, her breaths coming in ragged gasps.*

**Ally Martin**: "I saw him tear through a group of street vendors, their pleas for mercy swallowed by the metal screech of his blades. I… I hid, watched from the shadows as he tore through the streets, leaving a trail of blood and broken bodies in his wake." 

*The video ends abruptly, the screen fading to static.*
