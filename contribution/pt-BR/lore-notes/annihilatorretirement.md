*You stumble upon a battered datapad tucked beneath a loose floorboard. It's cracked and dusty, but still powered on. A single file blinks invitingly on the screen: "Retirement Announcement." You open it.*

>To my fans, my rivals, and anyone who ever dared to call me 'Augmented Annihilator,'

>This ain't easy to type, but the chrome's starting to feel heavier than the punches. My cybernetics, they ain't just tools anymore, they're shackles. Every jolt of power feels like a betrayal, every enhanced limb aches with a memory of a fight won, and a body broken.

>I remember when I first stepped into the cage, all wired up and hungry for glory. The roar of the crowd, the sting of blood, the sweet taste of victory...it was intoxicating. I climbed the ranks, beat down every contender who dared to stand before me. But somewhere along the line, the thrill faded. The victories felt hollow, the pain lingered longer.

>The whispers started - "He's losing it," they said. "His augmentations are turning on him." Maybe they were right. My reflexes aren't what they used to be, my vision flickers with static, and sometimes, in the dead of night, I see phantom opponents circling me, their cybernetic eyes glowing with malevolent intent.

>It's time for me to walk away. To trade the roar of the crowd for the quiet hum of a workshop. Maybe I'll tinker with my own gear, help others find their edge without losing themselves in the process. Or maybe I'll just sit back, let the aches settle, and try to remember who I was before the chrome took over.

>This ain't goodbye. It's a see you later. And to those who still believe in the Augmented Annihilator, remember this: true strength lies not just in your cybernetics, but in knowing when to step away from the fight.

>Signed,
>
>The Annihilator
