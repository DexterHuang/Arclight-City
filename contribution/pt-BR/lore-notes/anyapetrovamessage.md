You find a battered datapad tucked behind a loose panel in the wall. The screen flickers erratically, but you manage to power it on. A grainy video feed appears, showing a woman with tired eyes and a determined set to her jaw. She's dressed in what looks like a hastily discarded CircuitBreak uniform,  a few cybernetic implants glinting faintly beneath the flickering lights of an unknown location.

*Static crackles for a moment before the woman speaks, her voice strained but resolute.* 

**"This is Anya Petrova, former security analyst for CircuitBreak. I'm broadcasting this knowing full well it could be my last."**

*She pauses, taking a deep breath. A faint tremor runs through her hand as she adjusts the datapad.*

**"For years, I worked for them, thinking I was contributing to security. Protecting the elite. But what I uncoveredâ€¦ it's far worse than any of us could imagine."**

*Anya's voice drops to a low whisper, her gaze fixed on something unseen.*

**"CircuitBreak isn't just a security firm. They're a weaponized shadow organization, operating under the guise of corporate legitimacy. Their 'hitman program' is a brutal reality, not some whispered rumor. They target dissidents, journalists, anyone who dares to speak out against MegaEstate's exploitative practices."**

*She gestures wildly, her voice rising with suppressed rage.*

**"They call it 'cleansing,' purging the city of 'undesirables.' But they're murderers, cold-blooded killers operating with impunity. They use their cybernetic enhancements, their connections within the ACPD, to silence anyone who gets too close."**

*Anya's face hardens, a chilling resolve hardening her features.* 

**"I tried to expose them, but they silenced my colleagues, threatened my family. Now, I have nothing left to lose. This is my final stand. I'm broadcasting this message to the world, hoping someone, anyone, will listen."**

*She stares directly into the camera, her eyes burning with a desperate plea.* 

**"Don't let them get away with it. Don't let them silence us all. Fight back. Expose their crimes. Remember our names."**

The feed cuts abruptly, leaving only static and the faint hum of the datapad. Anya Petrova's final message hangs heavy in the air, a chilling testament to the darkness lurking beneath Arclight City's glittering facade.
