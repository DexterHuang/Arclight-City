*You stumble upon a dusty VR headset lying amidst discarded weapons and empty energy drink cans.  Curiosity piqued, you pick it up and notice a faint blue glow emanating from its side. A holographic display flickers to life, revealing a recording labeled "AR Addiction Support Group - Session 17." You decide to take a peek.*

***Session 17: Welcome back, chooms! Tonight's theme is 'Blurred Lines: When Reality Bites Back.' Let's start with Sarah. How's your week been?***

**Sarah:** (Voice shaky, eyes bloodshot)  *It's...it's hard, you know? I thought I was getting better. I mean, I haven't replaced my arm with a plasma cannon this week, which is progress, right? But yesterday, I almost walked into a wall at the noodle bar because I was too busy chasing a holographic dragon across the street.*

***Group murmurs in agreement and sympathetic chuckles.***

**Mark:** (Booming voice, laced with irony)  *Tell me about it. Last week, I tried to pay for my eddies with a stack of digital ramen coupons. The cashier looked at me like I'd grown a second head.*

***Laughter ripples through the group.***

**Moderator:** *Okay, okay, let's keep it focused. Mark, you mentioned chasing digital dragons. How's that AR game affecting your real-world interactions?*

**Mark:** (Sighs)  *It's like...they're everywhere now. I see them in the shadows, lurking behind street vendors, even in my reflection. I swear, the other day, a dragon tried to steal my cyberdeck at the Red Bar. Turns out it was just some choomba with a fancy helmet.*

***A chorus of "Oh man, that's rough" and "Been there" fills the room.***

**Moderator:** *Remember folks, the key is balance. We need to find ways to disconnect from the AR, to ground ourselves in reality. Anyone have any tips for Sarah on how to avoid walking into walls?*

**Jessica:** (Softly)  *Maybe try a physical activity? Something that gets you moving and focused on your body, not the digital world.*

**Sarah:** *That's...actually a good idea. Maybe I could join that parkour crew I saw advertising outside the noodle bar.*

***The group erupts in applause and encouragement.***

***The recording ends abruptly, leaving you with a lingering sense of both amusement and unease.***
