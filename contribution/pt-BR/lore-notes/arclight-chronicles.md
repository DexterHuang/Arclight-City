_Entry #34:_

Today was supposed to be a normal day, just another job for me. But fate had something else in store. My contact led me straight into a trap set by the rival gang. We were ambushed, and within minutes, everyone around us turned into bloodthirsty monsters. It felt like hell broke loose.

In the midst of chaos, I managed to escape and hide in an abandoned warehouse nearby. As I catch my breath, I realize how lucky I am to be alive. But now what? Should I report back to my employer about the failed mission? Or should I try finding another job elsewhere before they come after me next?

One thing is certain though—this incident has left me shaken. Maybe it's time for a change. Time to reevaluate everything and start fresh somewhere new. Only time will tell.
