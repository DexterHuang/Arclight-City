>Introduction:
This report details recent findings regarding gang activity in District 13 of Arclight City. Our team has been monitoring these groups closely due to their increasing influence and involvement in organized crime. We aim to shed light on their operations and identify potential threats posed by them.

>Gang Structure:
The two main gangs operating in District 13 are the Night Dragons and the Iron Horsemen. Both groups consist primarily of young men and women aged 16-25 years old. Their leadership structure appears decentralized, with multiple leaders managing different aspects of their operations. These include drug trafficking, protection rackets, and cybercrime.

>Recent Activities:
Our investigation revealed that both gangs have been expanding their territories beyond District 13 into neighboring areas controlled by rival gangs. This expansion seems driven largely by competition for resources and control over lucrative criminal enterprises. Additionally, we observed increased violence among members as they compete for prominence within their respective gangs.

>Conclusion:
While neither gang poses an immediate threat to national security at present, their continued growth and involvement in organized crime warrant close monitoring from law enforcement agencies. It is crucial that efforts be made to dismantle these criminal networks before they escalate further and pose greater risks to society as a whole.
