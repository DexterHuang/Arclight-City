*Location: Gang Stronghold, Arclight City*

In the dimly lit hallway of the gang stronghold, two figures could be seen arguing intensely. One figure, a man dressed in a worn leather jacket and jeans, held something shiny in his hand while pointing accusingly at another man standing across from him. The latter appeared nervous and kept glancing around anxiously.

After several tense moments, the argument seemed to escalate as both parties began shouting at each other. Suddenly, without warning, the first man lunged forward and stabbed the other man multiple times before fleeing down a nearby alleyway.

Left behind was a bloody mess and an unsettled silence filled the air. As sirens blared in the distance, it became clear that trouble had just come knocking on someone's door.
