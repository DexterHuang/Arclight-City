As per our recent investigation into CircuitBreak's illegal activities, we have discovered that they are not only providing security services but also operating as a hitman organization. Our sources reveal that their clients include some of the most influential people in Arclight City, including CEOs and politicians. This information is highly confidential and must be handled with extreme caution.

I can't believe what I just found out! CircuitBreak has been involved in some serious shady business. They aren't just providing security services, they are also a hitman organization working for the rich and powerful of Arclight City. This is huge news that needs to be shared with everyone. We need to expose them before it's too late!
