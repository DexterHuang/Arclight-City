You stumble upon an old journal lying on the floor of the gang stronghold. It's covered in dust and grime, but it looks like it hasn't been touched for quite some time. You open it carefully, hoping to gain some insight into the gang members who once inhabited this place.

Dear Diary,

Today was a rough day. Hana's laughter still echoes in my head as she covered yet another gruesome murder on her Vtuber channel. It's hard to believe that people find her light-hearted approach entertaining. I can't help but think about the pain and suffering those victims must have gone through, reduced to mere entertainment for others.

Jack Jackson is relentless in his pursuit of exposing CircuitBreak's hitman organization. He's put himself in danger more times than I can count, but he refuses to back down. It's admirable, yet terrifying at the same time. I worry about him every day.

Elita Thomas crossed paths with me today. She seemed lost and confused, trying to find her way through the chaos of Arclight City. I offered her some advice, but I can't help but wonder if it was enough. This city swallows people whole; it's easy to get swept up in its darkness.

I'm tired, diary. Tired of the violence, the corruption, and the constant fear that permeates every aspect of life here. But I can't give up. There has to be a way to make a difference, to bring some light into this dark world.

Until tomorrow,
Pearle Wilson
