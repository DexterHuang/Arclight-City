Interviewer: Detective Veronica Hart
Interviewee: Rayshell Lewis

Detective Veronica Hart (DVH): State your name and occupation for the record.

Rayshell Lewis (RL): My name is Rayshell Lewis, and I'm a freelance journalist.

DVH: Mr. Lewis, we have reason to believe you were in contact with a known member of the CircuitBreak hitman organization. Can you explain this connection?

RL: Yes, I was investigating a story about the growing influence of mega corporations on Arclight City's law enforcement. CircuitBreak was mentioned as being involved in some shady dealings. I wanted to gather evidence and expose the truth.

DVH: And how did you establish contact with this individual?

RL: Through a source who goes by the name "Neon Nero." He's an ex-member of CircuitBreak, disgruntled with their operations and willing to provide information in exchange for protection.

DVH: What sort of information did Neon Nero provide you?

RL: Details about a hit contract on a prominent whistleblower who was going to expose some of CircuitBreak's dirty dealings. I was hoping to warn the target and gather more evidence against the organization.

DVH: Did you manage to contact the whistleblower successfully?

RL: Unfortunately, no. Before I could reach them, they were attacked by a group of mercenaries hired by CircuitBreak. They're currently in critical condition at Trauma Team Medical Center.

DVH: And what about your source, Neon Nero? Have you seen or heard from him since the attack on the whistleblower?

RL: No, I haven't. After the attack, he went into hiding, fearing for his own safety. I haven't been able to get in touch with him since then.

DVH: Alright, Mr. Lewis. We appreciate your cooperation and willingness to help us expose these criminal organizations. Be cautious in your future investigations and remember that you can always reach out to us for assistance.
