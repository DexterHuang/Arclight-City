You stumbled upon an old terminal on the wall, dusty and forgotten. Curious, you decided to turn it on, and as the screen flickered to life, a message appeared:

> Message from: Latrina Clark
> 
> *Dear Chrystal,*
> 
> I hope this letter finds you well. It's been too long since we last spoke, and I miss our conversations about the stars and our dreams for the future. Arclight City can be a cold and heartless place, but being with you made it feel like home.
> 
> I remember the first time I saw you, standing in line at the Pachinko parlor, your eyes gleaming with determination as you pulled the handle. I thought to myself, "This is the one." And ever since that day, we've been inseparable.
> 
> But now, things have changed. The Black Market job went wrong, and I fear for our safety. They know who we are, Chrystal. We can't stay here any longer. We need to leave this city behind and start anew somewhere else, where our love won't be tainted by the shadows of Arclight.
> 
> Please, meet me at the Voidtown District tonight. I have a plan, and we can escape together. I promise, my love, that once we're far away from here, we'll never have to worry about the past or those who seek to harm us. We'll be free to chase our dreams and find our Arclight-dream in a place where love can truly flourish.
> 
> Until then, remember that you are the sunshine in my life, and no darkness can ever dim your light. I love you more than the stars above.
> 
> Yours forever,
> Latrina
