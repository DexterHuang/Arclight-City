As you were looting the stronghold, you noticed a cyberdeck on a table, with a message open.

> I'm writing this while hiding in the dark corner of an abandoned warehouse, praying that the madness outside will subside. My name is Eveline Morris, and I am a survivor of the Arclight City Cyberpsycho Massacre.
> 
> It all started on the 18th of May, when the Black Market had one of its infamous auctions at an undisclosed location in the city. The auction attracted all sorts of people - from wealthy elites to lowly street rats like me, lured by the promise of rare cyberwear and black-market implants.
> 
> The auction was going smoothly until a group of Cyberpsychos crashed the party. They were armed with advanced weaponry and had clearly overdosed on their implants. In an instant, chaos ensued as they started targeting everyone around them, not caring if you were friend or foe.
> 
> I managed to escape the initial carnage by hiding in a storage room, but the Cyberpsychos soon discovered my hiding spot. I had no choice but to fight for my life using nothing more than a makeshift club and sheer desperation. In the end, I emerged victorious, but not without scars - both physical and mental.
> 
> As I write this, I can hear the sounds of sirens in the distance. The ACPD has finally arrived to clean up the mess left by the Cyberpsychos. But what good will they do? They're as corrupt as the Mega Corporations that rule Arclight City.
> 
> I don't know how much longer I can hold on in this dystopian nightmare, but one thing is for sure: I won't let the Cyberpsychos take me down without a fight. I am Eveline Morris, and I am a survivor.
