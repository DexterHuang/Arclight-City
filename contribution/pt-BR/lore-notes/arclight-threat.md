>Attention, Mercenary Scum!

I have been observing your recent activities in Arclight City, and it seems you have crossed paths with some powerful individuals. They have entrusted me with a task that requires your attention.

Pay 10,000 Eddies to the address below within the next 24 hours, or prepare for the wrath of those who do not take kindly to having their affairs meddled with.

Remember, you are but a pawn in this game of power and deceit. Choose wisely, or suffer the consequences.
