***Underground Magazine: Shadow Talk Issue #13***

_Anonymous Author:_

This issue of Shadow Talk brings you stories from the depths of Arclight City. We delve into tales of love, loss, betrayal, and redemption among its citizens. From the desperate struggles of everyday folk trying to make ends meet amidst rising crime rates and corporate greed, to the shadowy dealings of powerful figures pulling strings behind closed doors.

_*On the table lies a torn page from an old magazine with these words scribbled on it:_*

"Chloe, the Blue Haired Angel of Red Bar, has been spotted meeting with members of the infamous Whisperer's Crew. Rumors say they plan something big soon..."

_*Next to it is a folded piece of paper containing a handwritten poem titled 'Lost in the Neon Haze'_

"Neon lights dance in the night sky,
Guiding us towards our fate,
Through the endless maze we try,
To escape the neon haze."
