### Journal Entry: Maxine

To: Myself
From: Maxine
Date: 2080/6/17

I've been feeling restless lately. Ever since that last job went south, I can't shake the feeling that something is off. Maybe it's just the heat getting to me - this city never sleeps, and neither do I. But there's a nagging voice in my head, telling me that I need to be more cautious.

I know what you're thinking: Maxine, the iron-willed former mercenary who takes no shit from anyone? Yeah, well, even the toughest among us have their moments of doubt and fear. And right now, I'm feeling both.

The city is getting more dangerous by the day, and it seems like everyone has an angle. You can never trust a soul in this place - not even your own reflection. The Mega Corps rule with an iron fist, and the gangs are nothing but puppets on their strings. It's a vicious cycle that I've been a part of for far too long.

But enough about that. There is one person who brings some light into my otherwise dark world: Hana. Her bubbly personality and infectious laughter always manage to lift my spirits, no matter how deep in the trenches I find myself. She reminds me that there's still beauty in this twisted city, even if it's hidden beneath layers of grime and crime.

I guess what I'm trying to say is, Hana, thank you for being a friend when friends are hard to come by. And to everyone else out there: stay wary, watch your back, and remember that in Arclight City, trust is a luxury few can afford.

Until next time,
Maxine
