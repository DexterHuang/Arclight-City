You stumble upon a dusty, flickering terminal tucked away in a corner of the stronghold.  The screen flickers to life, displaying a grainy news report from a local Net-channel known for its underground coverage. The headline reads: "**Augmentation Clinic Bust Exposes Deadly Risks of Black Market Mods**" 

---

*Jack Jackson's voice booms through the speakers, his face grim as he addresses the camera.*

**Jack Jackson:**  "Another tragedy in Arclight City tonight. Authorities raided an illegal augmentation clinic operating out of a rundown warehouse in the Lower Grid. Inside, they found three victims, all dead from botched surgeries. This isn't just another statistic, folks. This is a stark reminder of the desperate lengths people go to in this city for a chance at something better."

*The footage cuts to shaky security camera footage showing paramedics carrying out stretchers covered with sheets. The scene is chaotic, lit by flashing red and blue lights.*

**Jack Jackson (voiceover):** "These victims, desperate for an edge in a city where cybernetic enhancements are increasingly seen as essential, turned to the black market. They sought out cheaper, unregulated procedures, unaware of the deadly consequences. The clinic was operating with stolen equipment and unqualified personnel. One survivor, who managed to escape before the raid, told us they were promised 'next-generation' neural implants for a fraction of the price offered by legitimate clinics. What they received was a nightmare."

*The reporter gestures towards a close-up image on screen showing crudely assembled cybernetics, wires exposed and sparking.*

**Jack Jackson:** "This is what happens when corporations prioritize profit over people. When access to life-changing technology is reserved for the elite, desperation drives individuals into the hands of criminals. We need systemic change, not just sympathy for the victims. This city needs affordable, safe augmentation options for everyone, not just those who can afford it."

*The report ends abruptly, the screen fading to static. You are left staring at the flickering terminal, the weight of Jack Jackson's words hanging heavy in the air.*
