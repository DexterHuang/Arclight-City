You find a battered datapad tucked beneath a cracked floor tile, its screen flickering faintly. It's dusty and scratched, but you manage to power it up. A grainy video recording begins to play. 

*A gaunt woman with weary eyes stares directly at the camera. Her name tag reads "Dr. Anya Petrova"*. 

**Dr. Anya Petrova**:  "This is Dr. Anya Petrova, humanitarian worker with the Global Relief Coalition. Recording log entry 47. Date: 2084/6/2. Location: Arclight City Central District. This city... it's drowning. Not literally, though the rising tides are a constant threat. No, Arclight is drowning in people."

*The footage cuts to shaky handheld shots of overcrowded makeshift refugee camps sprawling across the once-vibrant parklands of the central district. Children huddle together, faces gaunt and hollow. Lines snake for miles outside ration distribution centers.* 

**Dr. Petrova**: "They come from everywhere - coastal cities swallowed by the sea, parched farmlands choked by dust storms, entire nations rendered uninhabitable. Every day, thousands more arrive, desperate for shelter, food, anything. Our resources are stretched thin. We're doing what we can, but it's not enough. The city's infrastructure is groaning under the strain. Water shortages, power outages, sanitation failures... it's a breeding ground for disease."

*The camera pans to a tense standoff between a group of refugees and a squad of heavily armed ACPD officers. A young boy clutches a makeshift weapon fashioned from scrap metal.* 

**Dr. Petrova**: (voice trembling) "And the worst part? The resentment. The locals, they're scared. They feel their jobs, their homes, their very way of life is being threatened. Tensions are running high, violence is escalating. We're teetering on the edge of a full-blown social collapse." 

*The video abruptly cuts out. Dr. Petrova's final words hang in the air.* 

**Dr. Petrova**: "We need help. The world needs to wake up. This isn't just a humanitarian crisis, it's a global catastrophe in the making."
