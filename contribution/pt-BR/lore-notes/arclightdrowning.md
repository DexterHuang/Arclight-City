*You stumble upon a battered datapad tucked beneath a pile of discarded armor plating.  Dust motes dance in the weak light filtering through a grimy skylight as you pick it up, the screen flickering faintly to life. It appears to be a personal log, hastily compiled and riddled with grammatical errors.*

> This city… it’s drowning. Not in the literal sense, though the recent monsoon season did flood the lower sectors something fierce. No, Arclight is drowning in people. Refugees. Climate refugees. They keep coming, wave after wave, fleeing the scorched earth and rising tides of the Outer Zones.  

> The influx started slow, trickle at first. We managed, stretched our resources thin but kept afloat. But now… it’s a flood. Overflowing the shelters, straining every medical facility in the city. I haven't seen this many people in one place since before the Great Collapse, and back then, there was still hope. Now? It’s just desperation etched on faces gaunt with hunger and fear.

> The corporations don't care. MegaEstate keeps jacking up rent, squeezing every last eddy from those desperate enough to pay for a scrap of roof over their heads. CircuitBreak patrols the streets, more interested in keeping the elites safe than offering aid. And the ACPD? They’re just as corrupt as ever, turning a blind eye to the suffering while rounding up anyone who looks "suspicious," which these days seems to mean anyone with dirt under their fingernails and a haunted look in their eyes.

> Tensions are rising. Choombs are getting restless, fighting over scraps of food, water… even airtime on those flickering public terminals. I saw a brawl erupt just yesterday, two families brawling over a single ration pack. It broke my heart.  We're losing control, losing hope. And the worst part? This is just the beginning. The Outer Zones are collapsing faster than anyone predicted. More refugees are coming. Arclight can't handle it. We’re all going to drown together. 

> God help us all.
