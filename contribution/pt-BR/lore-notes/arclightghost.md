*You stumble upon a hidden compartment within a desk, its contents hastily shoved inside. Inside, you find a battered datapad, its screen cracked but still faintly flickering. A single file is open on its display, titled "Log Entry - 047." It appears to be a personal log from a mercenary.*

> **Log Entry - 047**
>
> Date: 2082/1/6
>
> Location: Sector 7, Arclight City
>
> Choom, I'm starting to feel like a goddamn ghost. Every time I think I've washed the blood off my hands, another memory bleeds through. This last job...it wasn't supposed to be like this.
>
> We were hired by TaiXing Cybernetic. Big money, high risk - classic gig for our crew. The intel was clear: infiltrate MegaEstate HQ and grab a prototype bioware chip they were developing. Easy in, easy out, right?
>
> Wrong. Turns out MegaEstate had beefed up security like crazy. We got through the perimeter, but we triggered some kind of alarm. Shit hit the fan, choom. Security bots swarmed us, and then the ACPD rolled up, guns blazing. I managed to grab the chip, but...there were civilians caught in the crossfire. Families, kids...I saw it all go down. It was a goddamn massacre.
>
> The crew got out clean, but I can't shake this feeling. We were supposed to be professionals, in and out, no collateral damage. But we left a trail of blood and tears. This ain't the life I signed up for. This ain't who I am.
>
> Maybe it's time to hang up the guns. Maybe there's something else out there, something better. Something that doesn't leave you haunted by ghosts.

> End Log
