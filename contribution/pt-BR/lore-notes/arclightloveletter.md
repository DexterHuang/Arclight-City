As you rummage through the debris of the gang's stronghold, your eyes catch a glimpse of something tucked away in a dark corner. A small, blood-stained notepad lies crumpled on the ground, its pages filled with hurried scrawls and smudges. You pick it up carefully, feeling a pang of sympathy for whoever this message was intended for.

*Dear Family,*

I don't know if you'll ever read this, but I need to tell you how much I love you all. This life we've been living in Arclight City has been tough on all of us, but I wanted to protect you, to give you a better future. You always believed in me, even when I doubted myself.

Tonight, I found myself caught in the crossfire between CircuitBreak and MegaEstate's mercenaries. Bullets are flying everywhere, and I don't know if I'll make it out alive. I just wanted you to know that I never stopped loving you, even when things got hard.

Take care of each other, and remember the promise we made: to build our own Arclight-dream someday, away from this chaos. I'm so proud of the person you've become, Georgianna. Corabelle, always be kind and brave like you are. And Kobe, never lose your sense of wonder for this crazy world we live in.

I wish I could have been there to see you grow up, but know that my love will always be with you. Take care of Mom, she'll need someone to lean on now more than ever.

Stay strong, and keep fighting for your dreams. This city might try to break us, but we are stronger than it realizes.

With all my love,

*Dad (or Your Lover or Your Name)*
