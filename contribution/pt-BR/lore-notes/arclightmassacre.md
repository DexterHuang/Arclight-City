As you were looting the stronghold, you noticed a cyberdeck on a table, with a message open.

Hello, whoever is reading this. My name is Penelopa Thomas, and I am writing this as a testament to the horrors I witnessed during the recent cyberpsycho massacre in Arclight City.

It all started on 2082/4/25, just like any other day in our chaotic city. The air was thick with the scent of exhaust fumes and sweat, as people rushed about their daily routines. Little did I know that my life would change forever that day.

I was walking home from work when I saw a group of people running towards me, screaming in terror. Before I could even process what was happening, they collided with me, knocking me to the ground. As I struggled to get up, I saw a figure emerge from the shadows – a cyberpsycho, his body adorned with glowing cyberware that pulsated ominously.

In that moment of shock and fear, the cyberpsycho lunged at me, his cybernetic arms outstretched. But then, out of nowhere, a masked mercenary appeared, firing a hail of bullets at the cyberpsycho. The sound of gunfire echoed through the alleyway as the two figures engaged in a deadly dance.

As I scrambled to my feet, I saw more mercenaries emerge from the shadows, their cybernetic enhancements making them seem almost superhuman. It was then that I realized the true horror of what I had stumbled upon: a battle between mercenaries and cyberpsychos, each side fighting for dominance in the dark corners of Arclight City.

In the chaos that followed, I watched as both sides laid waste to the surrounding area. Buildings crumbled under the force of their attacks, and innocent bystanders were caught in the crossfire. The city's once vibrant streets became a warzone, filled with the screams of the wounded and dying.

When it was all over, I found myself standing amidst the wreckage, my heart pounding in my chest. The mercenaries had emerged victorious, but at what cost? Dozens of people lay dead or injured, their lives forever changed by this senseless violence.

As I made my way back home, I couldn't help but wonder if this was the new normal for Arclight City – a place where cyberpsychos and mercenaries fought for control, leaving innocent citizens caught in the middle. All I know is that I will never forget the horrors I witnessed that day, nor the chilling sight of those cyberpsycho eyes, glowing with an unholy light as they hunted their prey.
