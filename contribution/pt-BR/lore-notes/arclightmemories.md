You rummage through a dusty locker, searching for anything of value. Your fingers brush against a worn leather-bound journal tucked behind a stack of dented energy bars. Curiosity piqued, you pull it out, noticing the faded inscription on its cover: "Memories."  Flipping it open, you find scribbled entries in hurried handwriting, the ink smudged in places as if hastily written under duress.

They say time heals all wounds, but the gaping hole left by that day just keeps widening. It's been almost six years, and I still can't shake the images from my mind. The screams, the blinding light, the dust...the endless, choking dust.  CircuitBreak HQ tower, once a symbol of corporate power, reduced to rubble in an instant. They called it a "tragic accident," a faulty reactor core. Lies. Everyone knows it was more than that.

My brother, Marcus, worked there. A bright spark, always tinkering with his cybernetics. He dreamed of joining CircuitBreak's elite security team. Now, all that remains are fragments of his dreams and the chilling echo of his laughter in my nightmares.  Dorelia, my best friend since childhood, also lost her life that day. We were supposed to meet for coffee that morning, celebrate her promotion at TaiXing Cybernetics. I still see her smiling face, hear her voice calling my name, a phantom echo in this desolate wasteland they call Arclight City.

They say the terrorists used a black market thermal nuclear bomb, something so horrifically powerful it turned the tower into a crater. But the government keeps mum about the details. They want us to forget, to move on. But how can you move on when the ground beneath your feet is stained with the blood of innocents? How can you forget the faces of those you loved, twisted and broken by an explosion that ripped through their very souls?

*November 12th, 2053*

They rebuilt CircuitBreak HQ. Even bigger, even more imposing. A monument to corporate greed, a stark reminder of what they took from us. They say it's a symbol of resilience, of the city's unyielding spirit. But all I see is a tombstone, marking the graves of our hopes and dreams.

I can't let them bury the truth. I won't let Marcus and Dorelia be forgotten.  Someone has to fight for justice, even if it means facing down the ghosts of the past.
