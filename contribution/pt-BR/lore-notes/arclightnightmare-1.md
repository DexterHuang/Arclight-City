As you rummage through the cluttered room of the enemy stronghold, a crumpled piece of paper catches your eye. You unfold it carefully to read:

> **I'm sick of it. Just sick.**
> 
> Arclight City, the so-called "Dream" for many, is nothing but a nightmare for those who live here. The overcrowded streets are filled with cyberpsychos and gang members looking for their next target. The Mega Corps rule everything from high above in their towers while we suffocate in the pollution below.
> 
> Just this morning, I had to dodge a bullet fired by some circuitbreaker during a turf war between the CircuitBreak and TaiXing Cybernetic gangs. Then there's the ACPD, who only care about lining their pockets with Netcoins and bounties on our heads.
> 
> And don't even get me started on the cost of living here! Rent is outrageous thanks to those greedy MegaEstate bastards, and cyberwear modifications are priced so high only the rich can afford them. I had to sell my kidney just to keep up with the latest tech trends.
> 
> Oh, don't forget about the Church of Pachinko fanatics and their Goddess worship. They think losing at the pachinko machines is some sort of divine test or something! It's insane.
> 
> On top of all that, I can't even enjoy a quiet moment without hearing about The Singularity Cult's delusional dreams of becoming gods through AI. Can you blame me for wanting to escape this madness?
> 
> But what's the point? This city has become my prison, and there's no way out. So here I am, just another cog in the machine, trying to survive another day in Arclight City.
