As you sift through the mess of documents scattered across a makeshift desk, your eyes catch sight of a crumpled, handwritten note. You unfold it carefully to reveal the following:

Dear Arclight City,

I can't take it anymore! The constant noise, the crowds, and those damn cyberpsychos roaming the streets... It's a nightmare just trying to live a normal life in this city. I swear, if I have to hear one more Vtuber laugh about some gruesome crime or pay another exorbitant rent to MegaEstate, I might lose my mind.

Why did I even come here? Chasing the Arclight-dream seemed like such a good idea at the time, but now it feels like nothing but a cruel joke. All I want is some peace and quiet, maybe a chance to make an honest living without having to dodge bullets or get caught in the crossfire between rival gangs.

And don't even get me started on the Black Market. Who needs that kind of danger lurking around every corner? I can barely keep up with my Netcoins as it is, but at least they buy me some semblance of security when dealing with those shady cyberware dealers.

Sometimes, I catch myself wondering if it's worth it - this constant struggle just to survive in Arclight City. But then I remember the look on my kid's face when we finally moved into our "luxury" apartment (read: overpriced and under-maintained) and think maybe... just maybe... there might still be a chance for us here.

But please, city, give me a break already! I'm only one person trying to make it in this dystopian nightmare you call home.

Yours sincerely,
Doll Roberts
