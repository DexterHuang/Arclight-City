As you rummaged through the gang stronghold, your eye caught sight of an old journal on a dusty shelf. Curiosity piqued, you grabbed it and flipped to the latest entry. The pages were yellowed and brittle, but the words jumped off the page.

**Entry #143**

*Today, I witnessed something that will haunt my dreams for the rest of my life.*

It was just another day in Arclight City; people rushing about, holographic advertisements flashing, the constant hum of traffic. Little did I know that it would soon turn into a nightmare.

*I was on my way to work at MegaEstate when I saw it - a Cyberpsycho.* The man's cyberwear had clearly been overused or tampered with, causing his eyes to glow an eerie shade of blue and his body to twitch uncontrollably. His teeth were filed into sharp points, and he was holding a bloody knife.

*He lunged at a group of innocent bystanders, hacking and slashing with reckless abandon.* The screams still echo in my mind. I tried to help, but who am I against such madness? In the end, it was the Black Market traders that arrived just in time, taking down the Cyberpsycho with their own brand of violence.

*This city... this life we lead - it's becoming too much. The crime rate is rising, and our trust in the Arclight City Police Department has hit an all-time low. We're left to fend for ourselves against these Cyberpsychos and gangsters.*

As I write this entry, I can't help but wonder: *Am I next?*
