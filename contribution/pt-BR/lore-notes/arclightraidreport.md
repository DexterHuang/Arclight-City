*You stumbled upon a flickering holo-display tucked away in a dusty corner of the stronghold. It’s displaying a news report from Hana, Sunny Sparkles herself, her usual bubbly persona replaced by a more serious tone.* 

***Hana (on screen):*** "This just in, choom! Arclight City’s underworld is buzzing after a daring raid on the Crimson Serpents' HQ last night. The entire operation was executed with surgical precision, leaving no trace of the perpetrators except for one calling card: a single, crimson rose left at the Serpent King's desk."

***Hana (on screen):*** "Witnesses describe the attackers as highly skilled, utilizing advanced cyberware and tactical maneuvers never before seen in this city. Local law enforcement is baffled, unable to identify any leads. But whispers are circulating about a legendary mercenary known only as 'V'.  This phantom figure has become a legend, rumored to be a one-man army capable of taking down entire gangs single-handedly. But who's behind the scenes pulling V’s strings? Is this a power play by a rival gang, a desperate bid for control by an ambitious corporation, or something even more sinister?"

***Hana (on screen):*** "One thing's for sure, choom, Arclight City just got a whole lot more interesting. Stay tuned for updates, and remember to keep your chrome polished and your reflexes sharp!" 

*The holo-display flickers and dies, leaving you with a lingering sense of unease.*
