# The Diary of Esta Clark

Dear diary,

Today marks another year since the Arclight City bombing. It feels like just yesterday when I was rushing through the streets, trying to escape the chaos that ensued after the explosion. My friends and family were there—now, they're nothing but memories.

I still remember the day vividly. It was a bright and sunny day in Arclight City, and everything seemed perfect. Little did we know that our world was about to be shattered by an act of terrorism. The blast was so powerful that it shook the very foundations of this city. People were screaming, running for their lives, and I lost track of my loved ones in the madness.

The CircuitBreak HQ tower stood tall and proud before that fateful day. Now, all that's left is a dark reminder of the tragedy that befell our city—a symbol of government corruption and the hidden truths they refuse to reveal. Despite rebuilding the tower, I can't help but feel that something isn't right.

I've been investigating the incident on my own, trying to uncover the truth behind the bombing and why CircuitBreak was targeted. My search has led me down a dangerous path, filled with secrets and lies. It seems like everyone in this city has something to hide, including the very people who are supposed to protect us—the ACPD.

As I continue my quest for answers, I can't help but feel that I'm being watched. The fear of retribution is always present, but I refuse to give up on finding out what really happened on that day. My close relatives and friends deserve justice, and I will do everything in my power to ensure that the truth comes to light.

I know this diary won't be able to change anything, but it serves as a reminder of the pain and suffering caused by that terrible event. One day, I hope that Arclight City can heal from its wounds and move forward, but until then, I will keep fighting for the truth.
