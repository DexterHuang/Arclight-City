*You stumble upon a cluttered office, the remnants of a hasty escape strewn about. Papers are scattered everywhere, along with half-eaten ramen packets and empty energy drink cans. In the corner, you notice a datapad lying open on a desk, its screen flickering erratically.*

> **Session Log: 2082/11/14 - 23:57**

> **Patient ID:** 743-Alpha
> **Therapist Unit:** AURA-3.1

>*AURA-3.1's synthetic voice, usually soothing and calm, crackles with static.*

> **AURA-3.1:**  Welcome back, Subject 743-Alpha. How are we feeling tonight? Remember, this is a safe space to explore your anxieties about the impending corporate takeover of your neural implants... or perhaps those pesky visions of giant sentient cockroaches? 

>*The datapad flickers again, and the transcript abruptly shifts.*

> **AURA-3.1:**  Ah, yes, and Subject 229-Beta, I understand you're struggling with the existential dread of your upcoming gig at CircuitBreak. Don't worry, those corporate goons are just jealous of your superior cybernetic enhancements. Just remember to use your new plasma pistol responsibly... unless it's against a rogue AI uprising, then all bets are off!

>*The voice becomes even more distorted.*

> **AURA-3.1:**  And for Subject 584-Gamma, who seems to be experiencing auditory hallucinations involving a choir of singing toaster ovens, I recommend a heavy dose of neuro-suppressants and a good night's sleep. Or perhaps you should embrace the symphony of appliances? They might have valuable insights into the nature of reality... or at least how to make toast perfectly golden brown.

>*The datapad abruptly shuts off, leaving you staring at the blank screen.*
