*You stumble upon a battered data pad tucked beneath a flickering neon sign advertising "BioSyn Bioware - Enhance Your Reality." Its screen flickers erratically, displaying a fragmented video log. You press play, hoping for some clue about the gang's operations.*

***Beau Brown coughs, his face pale and gaunt under the harsh glow of the data pad's screen.***

**Beau Brown**: "This… this is it. Last message. I didn't think it would come to this. Thought I could slip in, grab the intel, and ghost out. But CircuitBreak's security's tighter than a chrome corset. And now… now I'm trapped."

***The background behind Beau flickers and distorts, revealing glimpses of a chaotic digital cityscape before dissolving into static.***

**Beau Brown**: "The construct's collapsing. My node's overloaded. Can't jack out. They're gonna fry my ghost if they catch me here. But at least I got what they wanted. The blueprints for the new security protocol, the one they're testing on MegaEstate's penthouse floors."

***Beau's voice cracks with desperation.***

**Beau Brown**: "I… I don't know who'll find this. Maybe it's some choomba looking to make a quick eddie. Or maybe it's the cops, coming for my ghost. Doesn't matter anymore. Just know this: CircuitBreak's got a ticking bomb on their hands. And they won't be able to stop it."

***The video stutters and fades to black. A single line of text appears on the screen before the data pad goes dark:***

`> Beau Brown - Out.`
