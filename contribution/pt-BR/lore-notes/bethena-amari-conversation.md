> Hey Bethena, hope you're doing well. I managed to get my hands on some crucial intel about CircuitBreak's next big hit. If we act fast, we can sell this information to one of their rivals and make a killing! What do you think? We could finally ditch this godforsaken city and start fresh somewhere else.

> Let me know if you're in. We need to be cautious, though - CircuitBreak has eyes everywhere.

> Amari, I don't know about this. Selling intel to one of their rivals sounds like a recipe for disaster. Plus, we have no idea who we can trust with this information. What if it falls into the wrong hands?

> I suggest we lay low for now and gather more information before making any rash decisions. We can always revisit this idea later if things change.

> Take care,
