*On the screen, there is a video playing, it seems to be an interrogation session.*

**Interrogator:** Tell us about your involvement with the Church of the Singularity.

**Subject:** I don't know what you're talking about. I just went to their meetings sometimes.

**Interrogator:** We have records showing that you attended several closed door sessions with members of their inner circle. Care to explain?

**Subject:** Look, I got mixed up with the wrong crowd. I didn't mean any harm. Please let me go.

**Interrogator:** You'll need to do more than beg if you want us to believe that. Where did these meetings take place?

**Subject:** At a warehouse near the docks. It doesn't matter anymore, please just leave me alone.

**Interrogator:** And why would we do that? We have reason to suspect that you may have been involved in something much more sinister than attending religious gatherings.

**Subject:** I swear I wasn't! Just ask anyone, I'm no threat to society.

**Interrogator:** Then perhaps someone should tell that to the man whose face you smashed in during a botched robbery last week. Now answer the question, where did these meetings take place?

**Subject:** Alright, alright! They happened at a secret facility deep within the BioHaven District. But I promise you, I had nothing to do with whatever they were planning.

**Interrogator:** We'll see about that. Thank you for your cooperation.
