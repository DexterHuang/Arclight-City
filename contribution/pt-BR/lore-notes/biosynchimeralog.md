You found a crumpled datapad tucked beneath a loose floorboard, its screen flickering faintly. The edges are scorched, as if hastily hidden from something dangerous. You manage to power it on, revealing a shaky video log recorded just hours ago.


*The grainy image shows a gaunt man with bloodshot eyes, his face pale and drawn. He wears a BioSyn Industries lab coat, stained with what looks like dried blood.* 

**Ina Stewart**: "This is... this is gonna sound crazy. But I can't stay silent anymore. Not after what I've seen." *He takes a shaky breath, his voice cracking with fear and desperation.* "My name is Ina Stewart. I work in the genetic engineering division at BioSyn City Central. We're not just developing treatments, we're weaponizing diseases. They call it 'Project Chimera'."

*Ina looks directly into the camera, his eyes pleading.* 

**Ina Stewart**: "They've engineered a virus, a bioweapon, designed to be highly contagious and deadly. It targets specific genetic markers, meaning they can control who gets infected. They're planning to release it in the slums, blame it on a random outbreak, then sell their 'cure' for exorbitant prices. They'll profit from death."

*Ina pauses, his voice trembling.* 

**Ina Stewart**: "I tried to report this. I went to the higher-ups, even contacted the ACPD. But they're all in on it. BioSyn owns them, controls them. They threatened me, said I was delusional. Said I'd be dealt with if I didn't shut up."

*He wipes a tear from his eye, his face etched with despair.* 

**Ina Stewart**: "I don't know who will find this. Maybe it's too late. But someone has to know the truth. Someone has to stop them. Please... expose them. Don't let them get away with this."

*The video ends abruptly, the screen flickering and fading to black.*
