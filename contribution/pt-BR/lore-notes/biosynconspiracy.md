You stumble upon a hidden compartment behind a rusted metal panel, tucked away within a cramped storage room. Inside, you find a battered datapad, its screen flickering faintly. You pick it up, dust swirling around its cracked casing, and manage to power it on. A single file blinks on the display – “Truth_They_Want_Hidden.txt”.  Curiosity piqued, you open it.

> They’re going to do it. I can’t stand by and watch anymore. This isn’t science; it’s a goddamn death sentence disguised as progress. My name is Elias Vance, and I used to be just another lab rat at BioSyn Industries. Now, I’m a goddamn traitor. 
>
> They told us we were developing groundbreaking treatments for genetic diseases. Bullshit. They were weaponizing viruses. Genetically engineered plagues designed to spread like wildfire through the slums, leaving the elite untouched behind their fortified walls. The “Arclight Dream” they peddle? It’s a lie. A way to keep the masses distracted while they profit from our misery.
>
> I saw the blueprints. I saw the test subjects – poor souls ripped from the streets, infected with this abomination they call “Project Chimera”.  They don’t care about cures; they care about control. They want a pandemic that cripples the lower districts, making them desperate enough to accept whatever BioSyn throws their way: overpriced “cures”, mandatory cybernetic enhancements, whatever it takes to keep them docile and compliant.
>
> I can’t live with this knowledge anymore. Someone has to expose them. Even if it means sacrificing everything I have. This datapad is my only hope. If anyone finds this, please believe me. BioSyn is planning a bioengineered apocalypse. They’re playing God with our lives, and they’re winning. We need to fight back before it’s too late.

You close the datapad, a cold dread settling in your gut. Elias Vance's desperate plea hangs heavy in the air, a stark reminder of the darkness lurking beneath the neon glow of Arclight City.
