*The camera captures a dimly lit alleyway in Arclight City, where you can see the silhouette of two individuals meeting in the shadows. One of them is Colene Sanchez, wearing a trench coat and a pair of sunglasses to hide her identity.*

Colene Sanchez: "You're late."
*The other person, Vevay Flores, nervously adjusts their cybernetic arm as they approach Colene. They are wearing a hoodie with the hood pulled over their head.*

Vevay Flores: "I had some... complications. But I have what you need."
*Colene crosses her arms and raises an eyebrow, skeptical of Vevay's explanation.*

Colene Sanchez: "Show me the goods first."
*Vevay hesitates for a moment before reaching into their coat pocket and pulling out a small, encrypted data drive. They hand it over to Colene, who inspects it carefully.*

Colene Sanchez: "This better be worth the risk."
*As Colene walks away, Vevay watches her go with a mix of relief and concern etched on their face. Suddenly, a group of masked individuals emerges from the shadows, weapons drawn.*

Masked Figure #1: "Freeze! This deal is not authorized by our boss."
*Vevay's eyes widen in fear as they realize they've been set up. A tense standoff ensues between Vevay and the masked figures.*

*Unfortunately, the security camera feed cuts out abruptly, leaving the outcome of the confrontation uncertain.*
