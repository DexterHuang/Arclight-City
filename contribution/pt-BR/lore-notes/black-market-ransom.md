You walk through the shadowy alley, heart pounding as you approach the enemy's stronghold. The air is thick with tension and the faint scent of ozone from nearby cybernetic implants. Your hand grips your weapon tightly as you push open the rusted metal door. A dimly lit room filled with discarded tech and scattered debris greets you.

As you scan the area for any valuable intel, your eyes catch a glimmer of light reflecting off a dusty laptop screen. Intrigued, you approach cautiously, ready to defend yourself if necessary. The file on the desktop catches your attention - "Ransom Note." With bated breath, you open it.

> RANSOM NOTE
>
> Dear Mercenary,
>
> You think you can just waltz into our territory and steal from us? Well, think again. We have your friend, Aeriela Young, and if you want her back alive, you'll do as we say.
>
> Meet us at the Black Market Exchange in Eclipse Wasteland District tonight, 2300 hours, sharp. Come alone and empty-handed or else she'll be... gone. Trust me, you don't want that.
>
> Bring with you 100 Netcoins and a prototype Cybernetic Arm from TaiXing Cybernetic as proof of your loyalty. Failure to comply will result in dire consequences not only for Aeriela but also for others close to you. We have our eyes on Robinetta Morris too, you know?
>
> This is no game, merc. Make the choice wisely.
>
> Zero Byte

You feel a cold sweat breaking out on your forehead as you contemplate the message. The choice seems clear: either betray your comrades or risk losing Aeriela forever. But what about Robinetta? And what kind of person is this mysterious hacker, Zero Byte?

As you weigh your options, the sound of footsteps echoes through the abandoned room. You know the decision can't wait any longer...
