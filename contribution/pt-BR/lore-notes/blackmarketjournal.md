Title: Ren's Lament
---
As you enter the dimly lit back alley, you notice a torn piece of paper lying on the ground. You pick it up and read:

> *Ren's Journal Entry*
> 
> Today was another day in the Black Market. The usual chaos, haggling, and the feeling that someone might pull out a gun at any moment. I don't know how much longer I can keep this place running without losing myself completely to it.
> 
> There was a new face today – Maddox Miller. He came in with a strange look in his eyes, like he was lost or searching for something. I could tell he wasn't part of any gang or a regular in the market. I tried not to show my curiosity, but I couldn't help thinking about what brought him here.
> 
> As I watched him navigate through the crowds and whispered deals, I realized how much I miss the simpler times. Before the power, before the fear, when I was just another girl trying to make her way in this city. But now, there's no going back. The weight of my responsibilities is too heavy, and the blood on my hands – it seems like it will never wash away.
> 
> Sometimes I dream about leaving Arclight City and starting anew somewhere else. Someplace where people smile more, and life isn't a constant struggle for survival. But then I remember that this city is all I have left. This market... it's my home now.
> 
> And so, as the sun sets on another day in the Black Market, I can only hope that tomorrow will be less lonely – and that maybe, just maybe, I'll find a way to break free from this cycle of violence and deceit.

You look around, wondering if Maddox Miller is still around or if he has already left the market. The thought of his lost eyes lingers in your mind as you continue on your mission to explore the hostile stronghold.
