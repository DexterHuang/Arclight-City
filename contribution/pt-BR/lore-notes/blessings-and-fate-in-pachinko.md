> Excerpt from the Book of Pachinko: Chapter 4 Verse 9-15
> "And the Lord spake unto Moses, saying, 'Speak thou unto the children of Israel, that they bring me an offering; of every man that giveth it willingly ye shall take the offering for me.' And the children of Israel brought a willing offering unto the LORD, every man and woman, whose heart made them willing to bring for all manner of work, which the LORD had given in commandment to be made by the rulers and by the people, to be done."

> From the teachings of Brother Zhao, leader of the Church of Pachinko:
> "Pachinko is more than just a game. It is our pathway to enlightenment. When we play Pachinko, we surrender ourselves completely to the will of the gods. We become one with the ball, feeling its every twist and turn as it travels through the maze. Just as the ball may fall into a hole or land upon a jackpot, so too does fate guide us along our own journey. Through Pachinko, we learn acceptance and humility before the greater powers that be."

> Ritual of the Lost Soul:
> At midnight, members of the Church of Pachinko gather around a large Pachinko machine. Each participant places a single coin into the slot and takes turns pulling the lever to release the balls. As the balls fly through the air, chanting fills the room:
> "Hail to the gods of chance! May our souls be cleansed in thy glorious game!"
> If a player successfully guides a ball into the center hole, they are deemed blessed by the gods and granted special privileges within the church. However, should they fail repeatedly, they are considered cursed and ostracized from the community.
