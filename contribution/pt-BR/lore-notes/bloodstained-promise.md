*You found an old notebook on the floor of a dark room. The pages were stained with blood and tears.*

---

> Dear Family,
> 
> I know you won't find this note until it is too late but please hear me out. My life has been nothing but pain and suffering since we moved to Arclight City. The gangs here are ruthless and they will stop at nothing to get what they want.
> 
> I have tried my best to keep us safe, but the debts kept piling up and there was no way out. They came for me today, promising that if I didn't pay them back, they would take everything from us including your lives.
> 
> I am sorry for leaving you like this, but please know that it is not because of selfishness or cowardice. It is simply the only way to protect all of us.
> 
> Use the money hidden in my old briefcase under the bed to start a new life somewhere far away from here. I have left some clues about where you can find it, but please be careful. The streets are still dangerous even after dark.
> 
> Goodbye my loves, may God or whoever is listening watch over all of us until we meet again in better times.
> 
> Love always,
> Adriaens Harris
