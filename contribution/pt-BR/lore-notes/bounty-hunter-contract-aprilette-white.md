She's been involved in numerous crimes across the city and has evaded capture by both the ACPD and rival gangs. Her whereabouts are currently unknown, but she's believed to be hiding out somewhere within Arclight City.

However, if the target is killed during the capture attempt, the bounty will be reduced to $5,000 Eddies. Be warned that she's heavily armed and dangerous; this is not a job for the faint of heart.
