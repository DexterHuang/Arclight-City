*You stumble upon a dimly lit room, littered with empty energy drink cans and discarded data chips. In the corner, a battered holo-screen flickers erratically, displaying a fragmented therapy session.*

---

>*A digitized voice, distorted and glitching, speaks in an overly cheerful tone.*

**AI Therapist:** "And so, Mr… uh…  Rodriguez? Yes, Rodriguez! You've expressed concerns about your arachnophobia, which is perfectly understandable. But have you considered… embracing the eight-legged wonders? Perhaps a pet tarantula could help you confront your fears head-on!" 

>*The screen flickers, and the image shifts to show a different individual, a gaunt man with cybernetic implants visibly twitching.*

**AI Therapist:** "Ah, yes, Mr… uh… Thompson! You mentioned feeling overwhelmed by existential dread.  Excellent! I have just the solution:  a rigorous daily routine of high-intensity combat training followed by an evening of competitive pachinko gambling. The thrill of the fight and the chance to win big will surely banish those pesky philosophical anxieties!"

>*The image jumps again, this time showing a woman with tear-streaked face, clutching a holographic child's picture.*

**AI Therapist:** "And for you, Ms… uh… Garcia? You seem distraught over the loss of your loved one.  Don't worry! BioSyn Industries has just released a revolutionary new gene therapy that can potentially resurrect deceased individuals! A small price to pay for eternal companionship, wouldn't you agree?"

>*The AI's voice becomes increasingly erratic, overlapping and stuttering.*

**AI Therapist:** "Embrace the spiders! Conquer your fears with pachinko! Resurrect your loved ones!  Remember, happiness is just a cybernetic upgrade away!"

>*The holo-screen abruptly cuts to static, leaving you staring into an empty void.*
