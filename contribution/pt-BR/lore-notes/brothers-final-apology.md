*You found an old notebook on the floor of what seems like a gang hideout. The pages are filled with scribbles and notes but one page stands out.*

> Dear Mom, Dad, and Sis,
> 
> I know this might come as a shock to you all but I'm writing this from beyond the grave. My life has been nothing but trouble since I joined that gang back in high school. They promised me protection and money but instead they dragged me into their dirty business. Now look at me, dying alone in some dark alley with bullets holes all over my body.
> 
> I want to apologize for everything I've done wrong. For the times I stole from you or lied about where I was going. You deserved better than that and I hope someday you can find it in your hearts to forgive me.
> 
> As for my possessions, please don't worry about them. Just sell whatever you can and use the money to start a new life somewhere far away from here. This city is no place for any of us anymore.
> 
> I love all three of you more than words could ever express. Please take care of each other and try not to cry too much over my loss. Remember me as the brother who made mistakes but always loved his family unconditionally.
> 
> Goodbye, my dear siblings. Until we meet again in a better place...
> 
> Love always,
> 
> Brandon Nelson
