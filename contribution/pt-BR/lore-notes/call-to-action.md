To All Those Who Will Listen

We, the forgotten ones, have had enough of living in fear and oppression. We live in a society ruled by greed and power, where our voices are silenced and our rights are stripped away. We are tired of watching our loved ones suffer while the rich get richer. It is time for change.

We demand equality, justice, and freedom for all. An end to the exploitation of workers and the poor. An end to the violence perpetrated against us by the authorities and the powerful. We want a world where everyone has access to basic necessities like food, shelter, healthcare, education, and opportunities to thrive.

We call upon all those who share our vision to join us in this fight for a better future. Together we can rise up against the system that seeks to keep us down. Let us create a world where every individual matters and has a say in shaping their own destiny.

Long Live the Revolution!

Chairman Wei Chang
