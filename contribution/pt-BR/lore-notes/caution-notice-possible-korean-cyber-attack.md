*The screen flickers on showing a video recording*

*In the video, a woman named Belle Robinson appears to be talking directly to the camera.*

Belle Robinson: "Hey everyone, it's me, Belle. I just want to share something really important with you guys."

She takes a deep breath before continuing.

Belle Robinson: "So, I heard about this guy named Lee Jong-suk. He's supposedly from Korea and works for some big corporation called CircuitBreak. Apparently, he's pretty dangerousâ€”like, really good at what he does."

She pauses again, seemingly weighing her words carefully.

Belle Robinson: "Now, I don't know how true all these stories are, but I thought it would be best if you knew about him just in case. You never know when someone like that could show up and cause trouble."

Again, she takes another moment to collect herself.

Belle Robinson: "Anyway, that's all I got for now. Stay safe out there, okay?"

The video ends abruptly, leaving behind a sense of unease.
