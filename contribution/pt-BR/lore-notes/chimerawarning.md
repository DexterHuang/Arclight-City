*You cautiously navigate through the dimly lit corridors of the gang stronghold, the air thick with the stench of stale cigarettes and cheap synth-alcohol. You stumble upon a hidden alcove, its entrance concealed by a tattered tapestry depicting some long-forgotten deity. Inside, a flickering holo-display projects a grainy image of a woman with haunted eyes.*

> **This is not a drill. They're going to unleash it. Project Chimera.** They say it's for "population control," but they're lying. It's about profit. BioSyn wants to corner the market on gene therapies, and this engineered plague is their weapon. They've been testing it on lab rats, then moved to primates... now they're prepping human trials. I saw the files, the protocols, the cold calculations.

> I can't stay silent anymore. This isn't science, it's murder. My hands are stained with their secrets, but I won't be complicit in their genocide. Someone has to expose them. Please, if you find this, get it out. Leak it to the press, post it online, do anything. Warn the world before it's too late.

> They're watching me. They know I'm onto them. I don't have much time. This might be my last message.

> God help us all.

*The holo-display flickers and dies, leaving you staring into the darkness.*
