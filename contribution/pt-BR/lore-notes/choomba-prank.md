As you rummaged through the gang's hideout, your eyes caught sight of a crumpled-up note tucked away in a dusty corner. You picked it up, unfolding the yellowed paper with curiosity. The handwriting was messy but legible, and it read:

> *Prank Plan for Choomba Hannis*
> 
> Step 1: Steal a Cyberware from MegaEstate's showroom and modify it to look like an oversized, glowing heart. We need to make sure it looks as ridiculous as possible.
> 
> Step 2: Hack into the Red Bar's system and set up a fake advertisement for "The Heart of Hannis" - a new cocktail created in his honor. Make sure to spread the word around town so he gets excited about it.
> 
> Step 3: While Hannis is busy celebrating, we sneak into the Red Bar and replace his drink with the spiked one. As soon as he takes a sip, the Cyberware will activate, wrapping itself around his body like a giant, pulsing heart. It'll be hilarious!
> 
> Step 4: Record the whole thing on our cyberdecks and make a VLog out of it. The perfect Choom's crazy prank!
> 
> -Rozanne

The note was signed with a quick scribble, "P.S. Don't tell Kirstyn, she'd never let us live it down."
