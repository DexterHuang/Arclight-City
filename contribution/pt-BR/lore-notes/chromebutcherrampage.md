You sift through scattered datapads amidst overturned furniture and shattered glass. The air hangs heavy with the metallic tang of blood and ozone.  A datapad, still faintly warm, catches your eye. It's cracked down the middle, but the screen flickers to life when you pick it up.

**Cyberpsycho Rampage Rocks Downtown Sector!** 

By: Jack Jackson

2084/08/21 - Chaos erupted in the heart of Arclight City last night as a rogue cyberpsycho, dubbed "The Chrome Butcher" by terrified witnesses, unleashed a wave of carnage on unsuspecting civilians. The rampage began near MegaEstate's flagship complex, where the assailant, seemingly driven mad by an overload of illicit cybernetic implants, went on a brutal spree, leaving a trail of mangled bodies and pulverized infrastructure in its wake.

Eyewitness accounts paint a horrifying picture. "He was like a demon," one survivor stammered. "All chrome and fury, tearing through people with those razor-sharp claws. It was like something out of a nightmare."  The ACPD, notoriously slow to respond to incidents outside the elite sectors, arrived hours after the initial attack, finding themselves hopelessly outmatched against The Chrome Butcher's superhuman strength and relentless aggression.

In a shocking turn of events, it was CircuitBreak security forces, not the beleaguered ACPD, who finally brought the cyberpsycho down. A squad of heavily armed mercenaries, utilizing experimental EMP weaponry, managed to disable The Chrome Butcher's cybernetics, leaving him vulnerable to a final, decisive takedown.

The official death toll stands at 17, with dozens more injured. City officials have promised a thorough investigation into the incident, but many residents remain skeptical, questioning the ACPD's competence and raising concerns about the unchecked proliferation of dangerous cybernetic technology in the city.
