As you explore the remnants of the old CircuitBreak HQ, your eyes fall upon a weathered data slate lying amidst the rubble. You pick it up carefully and, after a moment's hesitation, decide to read its contents.

*The date is 2048/3/15*

**James Mitchell**,

I can't believe I am writing this down. My heart still feels heavy as if weighted by the memories of that dreadful day. You remember how we always talked about our dreams, the dreams of having a peaceful life away from this chaotic city and its ever-growing darkness? Well, those dreams were shattered along with the tower on 2047/2/15.

The news came as a shock, and I still can't grasp the enormity of the loss. Our friends, our family - all gone in an instant, victims of that horrendous attack. The government, they always tried to hide the truth, but now even the new tower stands proudly at the same spot where the terrorists struck their vicious bombs.

The government says it was just an accident, a tragic mistake by the CircuitBreak security team. But how can we trust them anymore? They knew about the bomb, they must have been involved in some way. Yet, despite all the evidence pointing towards a cover-up, they continue to maintain their silence.

I don't know what to believe in anymore, James. I just want you to know that I am still here, grieving over the loss of our friends and family. The pain is unbearable, but I can't let go of hope that one day we will find the truth and justice for all those who have been wronged by this terrible tragedy.

Until then,

**Samuel Walker**
