You found a datapad tucked under a loose floorboard, its screen cracked but still flickering. The faded logo on the back identifies it as belonging to Jack Jackson, the notorious investigative journalist known for his fearless pursuit of truth. You open the datapad, and a grainy video plays automatically. It's shaky footage, clearly shot on a phone, showing a chaotic scene amidst the debris of a once-bustling market street.

**Jack Jackson (voiceover):** "This is Jack Jackson, reporting live from the aftermath of what can only be described as an absolute bloodbath. The streets of Sector 7 are littered with wreckage, cybernetic limbs scattered like discarded toys. Witnesses say a single individual, a cyberpsycho driven mad by his own implants, went on a rampage, tearing through everything in his path.  The ACPD was nowhere to be seen, leaving the citizens to fend for themselves against this metal-clad monster. "

The video cuts abruptly, replaced by a text document titled "CircuitBreak Coverup." You read on:

> The official story is that a rogue cyberpsycho attacked Sector 7, causing widespread damage and casualties. But my sources tell a different tale. CircuitBreak, the so-called security firm with ties to the elite, was actually the one who brought this nightmare down. They dispatched their own black ops team, heavily armed and augmented, to neutralize the threat. Witnesses claim they moved with surgical precision, leaving no survivors â€“ not even the cyberpsycho itself.  They then swiftly cleared the scene, silencing any potential witnesses before the ACPD could arrive. This wasn't a rescue operation; it was a cover-up. CircuitBreak is playing both sides, using their mercenaries to maintain order while simultaneously eliminating anyone who threatens their interests.

> I have more information, names, dates, and locations, but this datapad is compromised. I need to get this story out, expose the truth behind CircuitBreak's actions. But for now, all I can do is leave this message, a beacon for whoever finds it.  Don't trust the official narrative. Dig deeper. The truth is buried beneath layers of corporate lies and blood.
