You rummage through a dusty drawer tucked away in a corner of the stronghold. It’s crammed with discarded tech, half-eaten rations, and a few personal effects seemingly abandoned in haste. Your fingers brush against something worn and leather-bound – a diary.  Curiosity piqued, you pull it out, noticing its cover is cracked and faded. The brittle pages whisper as you open it, revealing scrawled handwriting that speaks of a past long gone.

> May 12th, 2078

> It’s been ten years since the… incident. Ten years since my world shattered. Sometimes, I still wake up expecting to hear Mom’s laughter in the kitchen, or feel Dad’s rough hand on my shoulder. But the silence is deafening. All that’s left are echoes and memories, ghosts haunting me in the dead of night.
>
> They say it was a terrorist attack. A black market bomb, they called it – some kind of tactical thermal thingamajig.  CircuitBreak HQ, that steel monolith piercing the Arclight sky, reduced to rubble in an instant. My family, gone. Just like that. Vaporized by a blast meant to send a message, but all it sent was despair. 

> They rebuilt, of course. Bigger, bolder, even more imposing than before. But the scars remain. The city forgets, moves on, chasing its neon dreams. But I can’t. I carry the weight of their absence, the unanswered questions, the gnawing suspicion that the truth is buried deeper than they want us to know.
>
> What really happened that day? Who were these terrorists? Why target CircuitBreak? And why the deafening silence from the government? They say they’re investigating, but it feels like a lie. A convenient cover-up for something darker, something they don’t want exposed. 

> I won’t let them bury the truth. Not while I still breathe. I have to find out what happened. For Mom. For Dad. For all those lost in the inferno.

You close the diary, a chill running down your spine. The words echo in your mind, a testament to grief, anger, and a desperate search for truth. You tuck the diary away, knowing it holds more than just personal sorrow – it holds a piece of a puzzle, a shard of a forgotten tragedy that someone desperately wants to remain hidden.
