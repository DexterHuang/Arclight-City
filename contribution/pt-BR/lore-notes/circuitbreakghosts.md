You are rummaging through a dusty filing cabinet, crammed with old paperwork and forgotten mementos. Amongst the clutter, you find a worn leather-bound diary, its pages brittle with age.  Curious, you open it, the musty scent of decay wafting from its yellowed pages.

> October 12th, 2083

The rain is relentless tonight, mirroring the storm inside me. It's been six years since the CircuitBreak Tower fell, six years since my world shattered. I try to remember what it was like before, before the screams, before the blinding light, before the dust choked the air and swallowed everything whole. 

They say it was a terrorist attack, a black market thermal nuke detonated in the heart of that corporate monolith. But the official story feels hollow, sanitized. The government wants us to believe it was a rogue cell, an isolated incident. But I know better. There's something they aren't telling us, something buried deep beneath layers of bureaucracy and propaganda. 

My family worked there, my sister, her husband, their two little onesâ€¦ all gone in an instant.  They were supposed to be celebrating their anniversary that day. Now, all that remains are faded photographs and a gnawing emptiness that refuses to be filled. 

I haunt the rebuilt tower sometimes, standing beneath its gleaming facade, feeling the cold steel beneath my fingertips. It's a monument to corporate greed, a testament to the fragility of life. They say it's stronger now, more secure. But I see the ghosts in the shadows, hear their whispers on the wind. 

They want us to forget. To move on. But how can you move on from a wound that festers, from a truth they refuse to acknowledge?  I won't let them bury it. I will keep searching for answers, even if it consumes me.  Even if it means facing the darkness they try so desperately to hide.
