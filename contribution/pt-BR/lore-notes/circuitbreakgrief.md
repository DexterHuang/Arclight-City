You found a tattered datapad tucked beneath a loose floorboard in one of the abandoned offices.  It’s cracked and dusty, but still functional. You manage to boot it up, and a grainy video message flickers to life. It’s clearly old, the recording quality rough and the subject matter somber.

*The face on screen is gaunt and weary, framed by greasy black hair. A network of fine lines etch themselves around his eyes, hinting at sleepless nights and untold sorrow.* 

**Arliene Hill**:  "It's been four years…four years since they took them from me. My brother, my sister…gone in an instant. Just another statistic in the CircuitBreak bombing. They say it was a rogue cell, some black market fanatics with a 'tactical thermal nuclear bomb'. A joke, that's what it is. A pathetic attempt to explain away the truth. The government swept everything under the rug, just like they always do.  They don't want you to know what really happened up there on that day. They don't want you to know how many lives were lost, how many families shattered."

*His voice cracks, and he takes a shaky breath.*

**Arliene Hill**: "I used to work for CircuitBreak myself. Security detail, nothing glamorous. But I knew those people, the faces in the cafeteria, the guys on my shift. They were more than just employees, they were friends, family. And now…now there's nothing left but this empty shell."

*He gestures around the room, the camera shaking slightly.*

**Arliene Hill**: "They rebuilt that tower, bigger and shinier than before. But it doesn't change anything. It can't bring them back. And every time I see that gleaming monstrosity piercing the skyline, all I feel is rage. Rage at the government, rage at the corporations, rage at the world that let this happen."

*He stares directly into the camera, his eyes burning with a desperate intensity.*

**Arliene Hill**: "Don't let them bury the truth. Don't let them forget what happened here. Keep asking questions. Keep fighting for justice. For my brother. For my sister. For all of them."

The video ends abruptly, leaving you staring at a blank screen. The datapad feels heavy in your hands, a tangible reminder of the tragedy that unfolded within these walls. Arliene Hill's words echo in your mind, a plea for truth and justice in a city consumed by darkness.
