You rummage through a dusty box tucked away in a corner of the abandoned office, your fingers brushing against faded photographs and crumpled personal effects. Among them, you find a worn leather-bound journal, its pages brittle with age. You carefully open it, the musty scent of decay wafting up as you turn to the first entry, dated 2047.

> October 12th, 2047.  It's been three days since...since the blast. The world feels hollow now. They say it was a "terrorist attack," some fringe group with delusions of grandeur. But how can you call them terrorists when they were fighting for something? For justice, for equality, for a city that doesn't chew up its people and spit them out like broken toys.

> My brother, Marcus...he worked for CircuitBreak back then. Said it was a good gig, steady pay, benefits. He always wanted to get his cyberarm upgraded, the one he got in that accident years ago.  He never made it home that day. Neither did Sarah, my best friend since childhood. She was supposed to meet Marcus for dinner after work, celebrate their promotion together.

> I can still see her face, bright and hopeful, as she waved goodbye at the station. Now all that's left are memories, ghosts haunting the empty spaces in my life. They say the bomb was a "black market" device, some kind of tactical thermal nuke.  But something doesn't add up. The official reports are vague, sanitized. They talk about structural failure, but everyone knows this wasn't an accident.

> CircuitBreak rebuilt their tower, bigger and shinier than before. But the scars remain. Deep, jagged wounds on the city's soul. And the truth? It's buried somewhere, hidden beneath layers of lies and bureaucratic bullshit. I won't rest until I find it. Until I know what really happened to Marcus, to Sarah...to all those lost that day.
