*You stumble upon a dusty, battered datapad tucked beneath a loose floorboard. It's cracked, but still functional. Curiosity piqued, you power it up. The screen flickers to life, displaying a faded holographic image of a young woman with vibrant blue hair and a mischievous grin. A digital journal application opens, dated 2047.*

> It’s been three weeks since the… incident. Three weeks since CircuitBreak went quiet. My choom, Kai, worked security there. He always talked about how they were expanding, adding a whole new wing to the tower. Said it was gonna be a real showpiece, even bigger than before. Now it's just rubble. Dust. A gaping hole in the skyline where hope used to be.

> They say it was a bomb. A "rogue faction," some whispers about black market tech gone wrong. But it doesn't feel right. Too big, too messy. Kai wouldn't have died if it were just some random explosion. He was damn good at his job. 

> The government keeps mum. Says the investigation is ongoing. But I know they're hiding something. They always do.  They want us to forget, move on. But how can you move on when your best friend, the person who promised to teach you how to hotwire a hovercar, is just… gone? 

> I keep replaying that last message, Kai's voice crackling over the comm, saying he was heading up to the new wing for a security check. He sounded excited, like he was about to discover something amazing. Now it's just another reminder of what we lost. What they took from us.

> I'm not giving up. I won't let them bury the truth. Kai deserves justice. We all do. 

> **Entry: 2047-11-03**

> They rebuilt it. The CircuitBreak tower is back, even bigger, shinier than before. Like nothing ever happened. But I see the ghosts in the shadows, hear Kai's laughter on the wind. It's a hollow victory. A monument to their lies.

> I won't forget. They can try to erase the past, but it's etched into my soul.  They took so much from us. But they won't take our memories. Not while I still breathe.

*The datapad flickers once more before going dark.*
