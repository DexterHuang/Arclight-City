You rummage through a dusty locker, half-expecting to find nothing but moldy clothes and discarded weapons. Instead, your fingers brush against something stiff and papery – a worn leather-bound notebook tucked beneath a pile of greasy rags. Curiosity piqued, you pull it out, noticing the faded inscription on the cover: "Memories."

*August 14th, 2086*

The rain keeps falling. It's been like this for days, mirroring the relentless ache in my chest. They say time heals all wounds, but how can it mend a hole this big? Five years. Five years since the world shattered at the old CircuitBreak tower.

I remember that day vividly. The sky was clear, almost mockingly so, as I walked through the bustling crowds heading towards the tower's base. Rosana and Marti were supposed to meet me there. We had plans – a night out at the Red Bar, maybe catch some live music at the Rusty Sprocket. Simple things, now forever stolen.

Then came the explosion. A blinding flash, followed by a deafening roar that seemed to tear the very fabric of reality apart. The ground bucked beneath my feet, throwing me against a nearby wall. Dust and debris rained down, choking the air, obscuring everything in a haze of chaos. I clawed my way through the wreckage, desperate, screaming their names until my voice was raw.

But there was no answer. Only the echoing silence of loss.

They say it was a black market thermal nuke, detonated by some fringe group with delusions of grandeur. The government claims to be investigating, but everyone knows the truth is buried deep, hidden behind layers of official lies and corporate cover-ups. CircuitBreak rebuilt, even bigger and shinier than before, but the scars remain.

The scars on this city, on my soul. 

I keep their memory alive. I tell their stories, whisper their names into the wind. Maybe someday, the truth will surface, maybe someday justice will be served. But for now, all I have are these memories, and the gnawing emptiness that refuses to fade.
