*You found a tattered notebook tucked inside a dusty locker, its pages brittle and stained with age. You flip it open, revealing faded ink and hastily scribbled notes. One entry stands out, written in a shaky hand.*

> June 18th, 2086. Another day, another reminder. They say time heals all wounds, but the gaping hole left by that day in '47 just keeps growing wider.  Seventeen years gone, and still, I can't shake the image of the tower, engulfed in a blinding light. The screams... God, the screams. CircuitBreak HQ, they called it. A monument to corporate greed, but on that day, it became a tomb.

> My sister, Elaraâ€¦ she worked there. Brightest mind I knew, always tinkering with code, dreaming of building something better. And my brother, Marcus, he was security, thought he could protect everyone. They both died in the blast. The official story? A faulty reactor core, a tragic accident. Lies. Everyone knows it was a bomb. A black market job, they say. But who had the motive? Who would unleash that kind of terror on innocent people?

> The government swept it under the rug, buried the truth deep. They called it a "tactical thermal nuclear device," some fancy term to make it sound less horrific.  They said it was an isolated incident, contained. But I see the fear in their eyes, the way they avoid talking about it. They know. They know what really happened.

>  I won't let them forget. Elara and Marcus deserve justice. Someone needs to expose the truth, even if it means facing down the whole damn system. Maybe one day, someone will listen. Maybe one day, they'll finally acknowledge the horror that unfolded on that fateful day. Until then, I carry their memory with me, a burning ember of rage against the lies and the silence.
