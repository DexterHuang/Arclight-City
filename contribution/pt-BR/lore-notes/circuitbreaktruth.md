*You scan the grimy walls of this abandoned warehouse, searching for anything useful.  Behind a rusted metal sheet, you find a dusty old datapad, its screen cracked but still flickering faintly. It seems to be displaying a personal log entry.*

> **2084/2/19 - Entry 37**

> They say time heals all wounds, but the gaping hole in my soul refuses to mend. It's been almost four decades since the CircuitBreak tower fell, since that black cloud of ash choked the sky and swallowed my family whole.  They called it an accident, a "freak malfunction" caused by faulty wiring. Lies. They don't want you to know the truth. I know what happened.

> I was just a kid then, barely old enough to understand. But I remember the screams, the panicked scramble for escape, the sickening boom that ripped through the air. I remember seeing my mother, her face contorted in terror, reach out for me one last time before the world went white. 

> It wasn't faulty wiring. It was a bomb. A black market tactical thermal nuke, smuggled into the heart of that gleaming corporate tower.  The government covered it up, hushed it all up. They said it was a rogue element, an isolated incident. But I saw the fear in their eyes, the way they looked away when I asked for answers. 

> They want to bury the truth, but I won't let them. I carry the memory of my family, of those lost souls consumed by that infernal fire, as a burning torch.  Someday, the world will know what truly happened at CircuitBreak. Someday, they will face justice for their crimes. 

> Until then, I will remember. I will never forget.
