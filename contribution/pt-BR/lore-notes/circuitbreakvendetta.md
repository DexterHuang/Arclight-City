*You find a crumpled, grease-stained piece of paper tucked inside a dusty drawer beneath a cracked holographic display. It's faded and worn, but legible enough.  The handwriting is shaky, almost frantic.*

They said it was an "accidental reactor meltdown." A malfunction. Lies. They always lie. My Sarah, my little Liamâ€¦gone in an instant because some greasy CircuitBreak exec wanted to cut corners on safety protocols. Because they didn't care about the lives of the plebs living in the shadow of their gilded tower. 

I remember the day. The sky turned green, then red. A blinding flash, a heat wave that sucked the air from your lungs. Then silence. An unnatural, suffocating silence.  They said it was a "thermal nuclear device," but they never admitted where it came from. They swept it under the rug, blamed some rogue AI, anything to protect their precious corporations. 

But I know the truth. It wasn't an accident. It was a black market bomb, smuggled in by someone with deep pockets and even deeper malice. Someone who wanted to send a message. Someone who wanted to punish CircuitBreak for something...for everything. 

They took my family. They took my future. And they will never get away with it. I'll spend the rest of my days hunting them down, exposing their lies, making them pay. For Sarah. For Liam. For all the victims of their greed and corruption. 

Remember us. Don't let them forget.

*The note ends abruptly, the final words scrawled in a desperate, almost manic hand.*
