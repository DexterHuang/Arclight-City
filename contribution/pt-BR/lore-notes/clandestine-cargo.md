Greetings Charlie Flores,

I hope this letter finds you well. As you know, our latest shipment of NeuroBlockers was confiscated by the ACPD during transport. It seems we have been targeted due to recent successes in our operations. We need someone reliable and discreet to handle this delivery personally.

The package contains 10 units of our top-secret NeuroBlocker variant, designed specifically for military applications. Its effects are highly potent and addictive, making it extremely valuable on the black market. However, its misuse could lead to severe consequences including permanent damage or death.

The pickup point remains the same – Decaytown District warehouse #47. Be careful as the area is heavily guarded now after the incident. Our contact inside will provide further instructions upon arrival.

This mission comes with a substantial reward of €50,000 net (paid in Eddies). Failure to complete the task successfully will result in dire consequences for both parties involved.

Trust me when I say this job requires utmost caution and professionalism. If you accept, please confirm your availability immediately via encrypted channel provided below.

Best regards,

[Signature: Wei Chang]
