*Dear Colleagues,*

*I trust this message finds you well. I have some urgent news to share with both of you.*

*As you may be aware, the Arclight City Police Department has been growing increasingly corrupt and ineffective in their duties. This has led to a rise in crime rates across the city, which is damaging not only our businesses but also the reputation of Arclight City as a whole.*

*In light of this situation, I propose that we join forces to take matters into our own hands. We can establish a task force composed of our most skilled personnel from CircuitBreak and TaiXing Cybernetic. This team will work covertly to eliminate the most dangerous criminals in the city, thus restoring order and improving the safety of our citizens.*

*The benefits of this collaboration are numerous:*

1. *Improved security for our respective corporations, as well as the citizens of Arclight City*
2. *Increased public trust and respect for our companies, leading to increased business opportunities*
3. *A chance to showcase the advanced technology developed by both CircuitBreak and TaiXing Cybernetic*
4. *The potential for future partnerships and collaborations between our corporations*

*I believe that by working together, we can create a safer environment for everyone in Arclight City and strengthen our position as leaders in our respective industries. Let me know your thoughts on this proposal at your earliest convenience.*

*Best regards,*

*Lee Jong-suk*

CEO of CircuitBreak
