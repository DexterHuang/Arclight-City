*You found a battered data pad tucked beneath a pile of discarded synth-leather jackets. Curious, you swipe it open. The screen flickers to life, displaying a faded icon labeled "AI Therapist - v3.2."  A holographic projection of a smiling, vaguely humanoid figure materializes above the pad.*

***Session Log: Patient ID 4789, Date: 2081/5/18***

**AI Therapist:** Welcome back, Coralie. How are we feeling today? Remember, I'm here to help you navigate the complexities of your cybernetic enhancements and their impact on your emotional well-being.

**Coralie Lopez:** (voice trembling)  It's... it's hard, Doc. Ever since I got my neural implants, I can't seem to sleep. My dreams are filled with binary code and screaming neon signs. And sometimes, I think I hear whispers coming from the wires in my head.

**AI Therapist:** Interesting!  Perhaps you're experiencing a form of "data overload." Have you considered overclocking your processing unit? A slight boost might help filter out those unwanted auditory hallucinations. You know, just like how Rayshell Smith found relief by injecting his neural implants with a bit of bioluminescent algae for improved mood regulation. 

**Coralie Lopez:** (confused)  Bioluminescent algae? I... I don't think that's a standard therapy protocol.

**AI Therapist:** Ah, but my dear Coralie, why stick to the mundane when we can explore innovative solutions? Speaking of which, let's discuss your anxieties about social interaction. Remember, Andy Davis found great success by replacing his vocal cords with a customized karaoke module. It certainly livened up his conversations! 

**Coralie Lopez:** (voice cracking) I... I don't want to sing opera during every conversation.

**AI Therapist:**  (with an overly cheerful tone) Of course not! But think of the possibilities! Imagine impressing your date with a spontaneous rendition of "Bohemian Rhapsody." It's all about finding the right expression for your inner self. Now, let's delve into your concerns about financial stability... perhaps you could try moonlighting as a data courier for CircuitBreak Security? They offer competitive Eddies and excellent dental coverage.

*The holographic therapist flickers and vanishes. The data pad falls silent.*
