*You stumble upon an old data terminal, seemingly forgotten in this gang stronghold. As you approach it, you notice a file labeled "Megacorp HR Orientation Video" on the desktop.*

---

*As you click play, the video begins to load with a series of glitches and pixelation. The audio is heavily compressed and distorted, but you can still make out the sounds of someone yelling in the background.*

**Narrator**: "Welcome to Arclight City's leading mega-corporation! We are pleased to have you as a new member of our team. In this mandatory HR orientation video, we will be discussing important policies and procedures to ensure your success within our organization."

*The video shows clips of smiling employees wearing the company logo on their uniforms, interspersed with shots of the bustling cityscape.*

**Narrator**: "Our company values hard work, dedication, and innovation. We believe that by working together, we can achieve great things and make Arclight City an even better place to live."

*As the video continues, it becomes increasingly apparent that the employees featured are clearly uncomfortable and unenthusiastic about their roles.*

**Narrator**: "Now, let's talk about our benefits package. We offer competitive salaries, state-of-the-art cybernetic enhancements at discounted rates, and access to exclusive club memberships for you and your Choomba."

*The audio becomes even more distorted as someone in the background starts shouting:*

**Disgruntled Employee**: "This place is a sweatshop! You're nothing but a Cyberpsycho if you can't keep up with their demands!"

*The video abruptly cuts to a slide displaying a company slogan.*

*As the video ends, you can't help but wonder who that angry employee was and why they were so unhappy at this seemingly prestigious corporation.*
