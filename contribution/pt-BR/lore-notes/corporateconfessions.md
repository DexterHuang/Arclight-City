Dear Diary,

Today was another day of disgusting business practices at CircuitBreak. I can't believe the things we do in the name of profit. The CEO, Robert Smith, is a snake. He has no regard for human life and only cares about lining his pockets. Our company provides hitman services to the elite, but what kind of person am I if I help carry out these atrocities?

Maxine, that dangerous woman who runs the weapon shop downtown, came in today for a meeting. She's a former mercenary and knows how this game works better than anyone. We discussed an upcoming gig for one of MegaEstate's executives. They want him dead because he found out about their shady real estate deals and was threatening to expose them. It sickens me to think that we are part of such a corrupt system.

I tried talking to my colleagues about our role in all this, but they don't seem to care. They just see it as another job, another paycheck. I can't help but wonder if I'm the only one who feels this way.

The only light in this darkness is Jackelyn Sanchez, a co-worker of mine. She's kind and always has a smile on her face. We share similar values, and she's the only person here that makes me feel like there might be hope for humanity after all.

I don't know how much longer I can stomach working for CircuitBreak. Maybe it's time to start looking for another job, somewhere where I can have a clear conscience. But until then, I'll keep documenting these moments in hopes that one day, things will change for the better.

Goodnight,
Jonathan
