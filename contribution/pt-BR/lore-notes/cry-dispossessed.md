# The Cry of the Dispossessed

You stumbled upon an old, dusty terminal in the corner of a decrepit room. As you approached it, you noticed a flickering light, indicating that it was still somewhat functional. Curiosity piqued, you decided to turn it on.

The screen crackled to life, displaying a message written in bold letters:

> **WELCOME TO THE CRY OF THE DISPOSSESSED**

Scrolling down, you discovered that the manifesto was divided into several sections, each one detailing the group's ideologies and goals.

## The Problem

*The Arclight City Police Department (ACPD) is corrupt to its core. It serves the interests of mega corporations, rather than the people who live in this city.*

> **The ACPD has become a tool for maintaining the status quo, ensuring that the rich and powerful remain unchallenged.**

## The Solution

*We believe that a new police force should be established, one that is truly accountable to the people of Arclight City. This force would be free from corruption and would prioritize the safety and well-being of all citizens, not just the elite.*

> **To achieve this, we must expose the ACPD's corruption and rally the public behind our cause.**

## Our Strategy

*We will use every means at our disposal to gather evidence of the ACPD's wrongdoing. This includes hacking into their systems, conducting undercover operations, and gathering testimonies from victims of police brutality.*

> **Once we have compiled a substantial body of evidence, we will release it to the public through various channels, including Vtubers, journalists, and social media.**

## The Future

*A new police force, free from corruption and dedicated to serving the people, can be the cornerstone of a better Arclight City. But this is just the beginning.*

> **We must continue to fight for justice, equality, and a future where everyone has an opportunity to thrive, regardless of their background or social status.**

As you read through the manifesto, you can't help but feel a sense of unease. The Cry of the Dispossessed is clearly a group that seeks change in Arclight City, but at what cost? Are they willing to resort to violence to achieve their goals? And what role do mercenaries like you play in this struggle for power and control?

As you continue exploring the hostile stronghold, these questions linger in your mind, adding a layer of intrigue and uncertainty to your mission.
