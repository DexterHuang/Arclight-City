As you loot the stronghold, you come across a small metal box tucked away behind some crates. You open it to reveal a neatly folded piece of paper with a handwritten note on it.

*Dear CircuitBreak,\n\
I hope this letter finds its way to the right department. I am writing to express my deep dissatisfaction with the cyberware product I purchased from your esteemed company. The item in question is a "Titanium Arm Blade V2," which I bought last month for the hefty price of 50,000 Eddies.\n\
To be honest, I was quite excited to have this bad boy installed on my arm. It was supposed to make me feel like a total boss in Arclight City's mean streets. But what I got instead was nothing but trouble and disappointment. \n\
First off, let's talk about the durability. This thing is a lemon! Just yesterday, during a simple job for Lee Jong-suk's crew, it snapped like a twig while I was trying to chop through a metal door.\n\
But that's not allâ€”the damn thing also malfunctioned in the middle of a fight with some cyberpsychos. It started vibrating and humming at an alarming rate, nearly costing me my arm and my life!\n\
I am beyond frustrated with this product. I expected better from CircuitBreak, especially considering the hefty price tag. As a loyal customer (and let's not forget, an investor in your company's stocks), I deserve better treatment than this.\n\
Please rectify this situation by replacing my faulty arm blade at no additional cost or offer me a full refund. I expect a prompt and satisfactory resolution to this issue.\n\
Sincerely,\nFrankie Collins*
