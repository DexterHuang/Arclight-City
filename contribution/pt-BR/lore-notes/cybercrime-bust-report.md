On August 3rd, 2076, Detective Rebeca Scott responded to a call regarding suspicious activity at a warehouse located in the outskirts of Arclight City. Upon arrival, she discovered several individuals engaged in illegal cyberware modification operations. After a brief standoff, the suspects fled the scene leaving behind vital evidence including schematics and prototypes of advanced cybernetic implants.

An extensive manhunt was launched resulting in the apprehension of three individuals: Nolan Campbell (age 45), Sarah Johnson (age 32) and Marcus Williams (age 28). All three suspects were charged with conspiracy to commit cybercrime, possession of illegal cyberware components, and attempted murder of law enforcement officers.

This operation serves as a reminder that we will continue to crack down on these heinous criminals who threaten our society with their deviant practices. We urge anyone with information related to these individuals or their activities to come forward immediately. Together, we can cleanse Arclight City from these cyberpsychos and restore order.
