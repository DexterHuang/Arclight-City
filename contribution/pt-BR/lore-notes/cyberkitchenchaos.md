*You stumble upon a dimly lit room, wires snaking across the walls and flickering holographic displays advertising various brands of synthetic food. In the center sits a mangled table littered with overturned trays and shattered glasses.

> **[REDACTED]’s Cyber Kitchen Challenge - Finals Round Footage Log**

*The grainy footage flickers to life, showing a stage bathed in harsh neon light. A jovial host, his face plastered with a synthetic smile, gestures towards a table laden with steaming vats of nutrient paste and protein bars.*

***Host (Voice distorted):*** Welcome back, chooms, to the grand finale! Tonight, our finalists will battle it out for the coveted Golden Spork, proving their palates are worthy of the finest synthetic cuisine Arclight City has to offer!

*The camera pans to three contestants, each clad in sponsored cyberwear. They nervously sample the various concoctions, their faces contorting in exaggerated expressions of delight.*

***Contestant 1 (Slurring):*** This “Smoked Salmon Delight” is a real game-changer! The flavor profile is off the charts, I swear I can almost taste the…the…*he trails off, eyes widening*

***Host (Voice gaining an edge of panic):***  And now for the mystery ingredient! Drumroll please! 

*A robotic arm descends, revealing a sealed container. The host rips it open with theatrical flourish.*

***Host:*** Behold! A rare delicacy, sourced from…well, let’s just say it’s a very special location!  Prepare yourselves for the ultimate flavor explosion!

*The contestants hesitantly dip their spoons into the container. Their expressions shift from confusion to disbelief, then horror.*

***Contestant 2 (Voice trembling):*** This…this can’t be synthetic. It’s…it’s…organic! 

***Contestant 3 (Screaming):***  They lied! They tricked us! Real food! In a synthetic food competition?!

*The footage cuts to chaos. Contestants are shoving each other, the host is frantically trying to regain control, and someone has smashed the holographic display advertising “Nutri-Burger Supreme.” The screen fades to static.*

You notice a crumpled datapad lying near the shattered remains of the holographic display. It’s open to a chat log, the last message chillingly simple:

> *They’ll never suspect a thing. Organic food is just too dangerous for them to handle.*
