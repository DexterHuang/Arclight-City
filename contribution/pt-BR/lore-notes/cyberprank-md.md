As you rummaged through the cluttered stronghold, your cybernetic eye caught a glimpse of a crumpled-up note on the floor. Curious, you picked it up and smoothed it out. The handwriting was messy but legible.

> Choom's Crazy Prank Gone Wrong
>
> Hey there, Kipp Jones! This is Ashlie Lopez, and I gotta tell you about the most epic prank Hollyanne Stewart and I pulled on our choom, Wandis Parker. We thought it'd be hilarious to mess with his cybernetic implants, but oh boy, did things go south quicker than a dropped netcoin in the red bar.
>
> So here's the plan: We decided to hack into his personal terminal and reprogram his implants to activate randomly throughout the day. We figured he'd be freaking out with uncontrollable muscle spasms or seeing things that aren't there, and it would be the funniest thing ever!
>
> Little did we know, Wandis had just gotten a new set of cybernetic arms from TaiXing Cybernetic. Those things were so advanced they could learn from their environment and adapt to any situation. So when his arms decided to do their own version of the Macarena during his Trauma Team job, well... let's just say he got demoted faster than a MegaEstate tenant who missed their rent payment.
>
> The best part? We recorded it all on our personal vlogs! You should check them out - Hollyanne's is titled "Wandis Parker: Cyberpsycho Edition," and mine is called "Choomba Chaos." You won't believe the looks on our faces when Wandis started dancing in the middle of a high-stakes security mission for CircuitBreak. Priceless!

> Anyway, we learned our lesson - messing with someone's implants is never a good idea. But hey, at least we had a laugh or two. Until next time, chomps!
