You stumble upon an old, battered journal on the ground, covered in grime and dust. As you open it, you see that the pages are filled with hurried scribbles and smudged ink. The writing is unsteady, as if the author was in a state of panic or shock. You can't help but feel a sense of unease as you begin to read.

> I never thought this would happen to me, but today, I witnessed something truly horrifying. A Cyberpsycho attacked the Arclight City subway station. The sight of it will haunt my dreams for the rest of my life.
> 
> It was just another day in our chaotic city, people rushing to and fro, trying to make their way through the bustling metropolis. I was on my way home from work when I heard screams coming from the subway station. Curiosity got the better of me, and I decided to investigate.
> 
> As I entered the station, I saw a figure in the distance, its body glistening with sweat and covered in cybernetic enhancements. Its eyes were wide open, their pupils dilated like black holes, swallowing any light that dared come near them. It was a Cyberpsycho, and it was attacking innocent people.
> 
> I froze in terror as the creature lunged at a woman, its metallic hands ripping through her flesh like tissue paper. The sound of bones cracking and blood splattering against the cold, wet tiles echoed through the station, sending shivers down my spine. People were screaming, running for their lives, but there was no place to hide.
> 
> In that moment, I realized how fragile our existence is in this city. We live in constant fear of being swallowed by its darkness, yet we keep coming back for more. The world outside Arclight City might be safe and peaceful, but here, survival means adapting to the chaos around us.
> 
> As I write this, I'm still trembling from the ordeal. My mind is racing with thoughts of what could have happened if I had been caught in the path of that Cyberpsycho's wrath. But despite everything, I know I can't let fear control me. I have to keep moving forward, because that's what it means to be a citizen of Arclight City.
