*"Arclight City's Cybernetic Dream Turns into Nightmare"*

Date: 2081/4/7

In Arclight City, the pursuit of the "Cybernetic Dream" has reached new heights - or has it? As more and more citizens seek to enhance their bodies with advanced cybernetics from leading companies like TaiXing Cybernetic, a concerning trend has emerged. 

Recent studies conducted by the Church of Pachinko show that over 50% of Arclight City's population now possess some form of cybernetic implant or augmentation. While these enhancements are supposed to improve their quality of life and offer new opportunities, they have also led to a surge in "Cyberpsycho" cases.

These Cyberpsychos, once ordinary citizens, have crossed the edge after installing too many cyberwears or overusing their implants. Now, they wreak havoc on the city's streets, posing a significant threat to public safety. The Arclight City Police Department (ACPD) has issued an urgent bounty for these individuals, urging citizens to report any sightings and stay vigilant.

Despite the risks, many Arclight residents remain undeterred in their pursuit of the Cybernetic Dream. They continue to visit RipperDocs like Oriana for new enhancements and modifications, driven by the promise of a better life in this dystopian metropolis.
