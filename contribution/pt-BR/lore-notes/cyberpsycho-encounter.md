*You come across an old, tattered notebook on the floor, its cover worn out from use. You open it up to see scrawled notes and sketches on the pages.*

> Today was the day I saw a true Cyberpsycho in action. It started like any other day, but things quickly took a dark turn.

*You flip to a new page and see a crude sketch of a person with cybernetic enhancements.*

> **Name:** Alfi Jackson
> 
> *I'm just an ordinary guy trying to make ends meet in this city. I work as a janitor at MegaEstate, but I also dabble in art when I have free time.*
> 
> It all began around midnight when I was on my way home from work. As I passed through the Red Light District, I saw a group of people gathered around a man who looked like he'd been attacked by some sort of monster. His body was covered in scars and cybernetic enhancements, and his eyes glowed with an eerie blue light.
> 
> *I tried to help the victims, but the Cyberpsycho noticed me and came charging towards me. I could feel its rage pulsing through the air as it closed the gap between us.*
> 
> In that moment, I knew I had to run if I wanted to survive. I ducked into an alleyway and watched as the Cyberpsycho continued its rampage through the crowd. It was terrifying to witness such raw violence and chaos unleashed upon innocent people.
> 
> *After the Cyberpsycho disappeared into the shadows, I stayed hidden until the police arrived. They questioned me briefly about what happened but didn't seem too interested in finding the attacker. Just another day in Arclight City, I suppose.*
> 
> As I made my way home that night, I couldn't shake the feeling of dread that lingered in the air. The Cyberpsycho had left a lasting impression on me - one that will haunt my dreams for years to come.
> 
> *I hope whoever reads this finds some solace in knowing they're not alone in their fear of these monsters lurking in our city.*
