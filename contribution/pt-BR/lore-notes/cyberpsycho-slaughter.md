*You noticed a old terminal on the wall, and decided to have a look.*

I can't believe what I just saw. It was like something out of a nightmare. A man with his face completely covered in metal and wires walked into that bar, and before anyone could react, he started shooting at everyone indiscriminately. The screams were deafening as people tried to run for cover or fight back against this cyberpsycho.

I was lucky enough to find a hiding spot under the counter just in time, but I couldn't help but feel sick to my stomach watching all of it unfold. The smell of blood and gunpowder filled the air as bodies lay strewn about like broken dolls. It felt surreal, almost like I was watching a movie instead of experiencing something so horrific firsthand.

After what seemed like an eternity, the police finally showed up on scene - but they were too late to stop the carnage that had already taken place. The cyberpsycho had disappeared into thin air before any of them could get a good look at him or his weaponry. Now all that remains are questions: Who was he? Why did he do this? And most importantly, will we ever be safe again in our own city?
