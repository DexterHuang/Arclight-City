*You stumbled upon a small notebook lying on the floor amidst the rubble.*

As you pick it up, you notice that the cover is worn out, and there are smudges of dirt and blood staining its pages. You flip through the diary, finding entries from different dates, all leading up to this moment. The last entry catches your attention:

> *May 15th*

> I can't believe what I just saw... a cyberpsycho, right here in Arclight City. It was horrifying. I was walking home from work when I heard the screams. At first, I thought it was just another gang fight, but then I saw her. A woman with glowing red eyes and metallic limbs, tearing through a group of people like they were nothing.
> 
> She didn't even seem to notice me as she passed by, her gaze fixated on her next victim. It was only when I heard the sirens approaching that she disappeared into the shadows. I don't know if the ACPD will ever catch her, but I can't forget what I saw tonight.
> 
> The city is getting more dangerous by the day, and it feels like there's no escape. I'm scared for my life, and for the lives of everyone around me. What has this place become?
