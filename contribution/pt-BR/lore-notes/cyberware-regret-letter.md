> Message from: Debor Perez

Dear Family,

I know this might come as a shock to all of you but I am dying. The doctors say that my body can't handle the cyberware anymore and it's slowly shutting down. I want to apologize for everything I have done wrong in life. I was always too focused on myself, never thinking about how my actions affected others.

I leave behind these words as a way of saying goodbye and expressing my love for each one of you. Matias, please take care of our mother; she has been through so much already. Camella, continue to be the strong woman that I know you are. And to whoever finds this note after me... cherish your loved ones because life is too short.

Goodbye my dear family, until we meet again in another life or dimension.

Love always,
Debor Perez
