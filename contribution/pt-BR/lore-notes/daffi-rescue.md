*As you were looting the stronghold, you noticed a cyberdeck on a table, with a message open.*

> My name is Tyler Martinez, and I've been living in Arclight City for the past five years. I'm just an average guy trying to make ends meet, but lately, things have taken a turn for the worse. You see, my sister Daffi Roberts got mixed up with the wrong crowd - the notorious gang known as "The Cyberpsycho Syndicate." They've been causing chaos all over the city, and now they're using my sister as collateral to keep me quiet.
>
> I'm reaching out to you because I know you're one of the best bounty hunters in town. I need your help to take down The Cyberpsycho Syndicate and rescue my sister from their clutches. They have a hideout in the Derelict Junction District, where they've been operating under the radar for far too long.

> If you accept this mission, I promise it will be worth your while. There's a sizeable bounty on the head of their leader, Zsa Moore, and I'll throw in an extra bonus for a successful rescue. And let's not forget about the satisfaction of taking down a dangerous gang that threatens our city every day.

> Please respond as soon as possible - my sister's life is at stake!
