Hey Jace, did you hear about the latest news around town? Apparently, there's this legend going around about a certain mercenary named *Steel Breaker*. Supposedly he single-handedly took down a rival gang's hideout last week using nothing but brute force and his cybernetic enhancements. Word on the street is that he left behind quite the bloody mess...

But wait, there's more! Rumor has it that our dear friend *V*, the infamous solo operator, had something to do with this incident as well. Can you imagine these two powerhouses teaming up? It gives me chills just thinking about it.

What do you think, Jace? Any truth to these rumors? And speaking of legends, how's that project we discussed coming along? You know, the one involving that pesky Trauma Team squat? Let's keep our fingers crossed for its success!

Talk soon,
Moore
