Hey Milo, I heard you might need some cyberware work done? The Whisperer told me about your situation.

I can definitely help you out with that. As the best RipperDoc in town, I've got all the latest implants and cyberware components from TaiXing Cybernetic. Just let me know what you need, and we can set up an appointment at my clinic.

But be warned: The Whisperer wants a favor in return for referring you to me. She needs a crew to pull off a job for CircuitBreak, and she thinks you'd make a good fit. I don't know the details of the job myself, but if you agree, we'll have to move fast before the Arclight City Police Department catches wind of it.

Let me know what you decide, Milo. The Whisperer and I are waiting for your answer at the Red Bar. Don't be late - she can be quite impatient.

*Best Regards,*
