*You notice a broken terminal on the wall, after fixing it you manage to turn it on.*

*Oriana appears on the screen, looking slightly annoyed*

**Oriana:** "Hey Rayshell, listen up. I know you're good with a gun, but sometimes brains are just as important."

She pauses for effect before continuing. "There's a job going down at the MegaEstate building next week. It pays well, but it requires more than brute force. You need someone who knows how to hack systems and sneak around undetected."

**Rayshell:** (looking intrigued) "What kind of job?"

**Oriana:** "It involves stealing confidential data from Robert Smith's office. He won't take kindly to anyone poking their nose where it doesn't belong." She grins menacingly. "But then again, neither would we if we got caught trying."

**Rayshell:** "Alright, I'm interested. When do we start planning?"

**Oriana:** "Good choice, kid. Meet me at the Red Bar tomorrow night. We'll discuss details further."

With that, the hologram disappears, leaving behind a hint of excitement in the air.
