>It started just like any normal day in Arclight City. I woke up early, got dressed, and headed to work at CircuitBreak Security Corporation. Little did I know that today would change my life forever.

>As I walked towards the office building, I saw something strange happening across the street. There was a group of people gathered around what looked like a body lying on the ground. As I approached closer, I realized it wasn't just any body—it was a cyberpsycho!

>Panic set in as more and more cyberpsychos appeared out of nowhere. Their eyes were bloodshot, and they moved with an eerie mechanical precision. Before I knew it, they had surrounded me.

>I tried to run, but they were too fast. They cornered me against a wall and began attacking without provocation. All I could hear was the sound of metal colliding with flesh and bone breaking beneath their feet. It felt like an eternity before they finally left me alone.

>When I regained consciousness, I found myself covered in blood and debris. My clothes were torn beyond recognition, and I couldn't move properly due to multiple injuries sustained during the attack. Slowly but surely, I managed to crawl away from the carnage and seek help.

>The hospital staff told me that I was lucky to be alive after experiencing such a brutal encounter with cyberpsychos. They said that these individuals often went on killing sprees indiscriminately, leaving behind nothing but chaos and destruction wherever they went.

>To this day, I still don't understand why they targeted me specifically. Maybe it was pure chance or maybe there was something else going on behind the scenes. Whatever the reason may be, I know one thing for certain—I won't ever forget the horrors of that day as long as I live.
