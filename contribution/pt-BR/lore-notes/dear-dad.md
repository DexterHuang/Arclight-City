# A Letter to My Dad

Hey Dad,

I hope this message finds you well. I've missed you so much since you left for that last job. Mom says you're a hero who protects people from bad guys, but I just want my dad back.

Please can you bring me something special when you come home? Something shiny and cool like the cyberwear those mercs wear at the Red Bar. You know how much I love gadgets! And maybe, if you have time, tell me a story about your adventures. I bet they're more exciting than any Pachinko game or holo-movie.

I've been good at school and learning all about the history of Arclight City. I even joined the after-school hacking club! We learned how to use terminals and decode messages, just like you do on your missions. Mom says it's not safe for me to go out at night, but sometimes I sneak out with my friends to explore the Synth City District.

Dad, please come home soon. I need you to teach me how to defend myself and maybe even help me install a cool cyber-mod. I promise I'll be careful and not cross the edge like those cyberpsychos the ACPD always talks about.

Love you lots,

Your son/daughter (Name)
