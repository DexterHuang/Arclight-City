*You stumbled upon an abandoned office filled with dust and cobwebs.*

---

*In the middle of the room, there was a desk covered with papers and a small holo projector.*

---

*Upon activating the holo projector, a message appeared before you:*

>My dearest Marry,
>
>It seems our plans didn't go according to plan. We knew we couldn't trust the ACPD, but we never thought they would double cross us like this. Now we're stuck in this hellhole, waiting for rescue or death.
>
>If by chance you receive this message, please help us. Our contact at CircuitBreak promised to send someone to extract us, but we haven't heard from him in days.
>
>Remember when we dreamt about leaving this city behind and starting fresh somewhere else? Let's make that happen.
>
>All my love,
>
>Hank.
