# Complaint Letter to MegaEstate

Dear MegaEstate Executives,

I hope this message reaches you in good health and fortune. I am writing to express my utmost dissatisfaction with the cybernetic implants I purchased from your esteemed company a few months ago. The implants have been nothing but trouble since their installation, causing me more headaches than I care to admit.

As a regular citizen of Arclight City, I trusted MegaEstate's reputation and expertise in providing top-of-the-line cyberware. However, it seems that my trust was misplaced. The implants have been malfunctioning constantly, causing me more harm than good.

I had high hopes for the "Ultimate Senses" package, which promised to enhance my vision, hearing, and even taste buds. Instead, I've found myself dealing with a constant buzzing noise in my ears, an inability to distinguish between colors, and food tasting like it's been dipped in rusty metal.

I have tried reaching out to your customer support department multiple times, but the response has been far from satisfactory. The representatives either couldn't understand my issues or brushed them off as "normal side effects." I find this unacceptable considering the hefty price I paid for these implants.

Moreover, I have been unable to perform my daily tasks effectively due to the malfunctioning cyberware. This has led to significant losses in both my professional and personal life. It's disheartening to see that a company as reputed as MegaEstate can produce such subpar products.

I kindly request that you address this issue immediately by either providing a full refund or replacing the faulty implants with properly functioning ones. I expect a swift resolution to this matter, as I should not be held responsible for your company's negligence.

In anticipation of your prompt response,

Krysta Clark
