> Message from: Robert Turner

Dear Bounty Hunter,

I am Robert Turner, an investigative journalist working for the Arclight Tribune. My source has uncovered information about a high-value target that goes by the name Doll Scott. This individual is suspected to be involved in a series of high-profile cybercrimes and has connections with the notorious CircuitBreak security company.

Doll Scott is known for their expertise in hacking and using advanced cyberwarfare technology, making them a significant threat to Arclight City's stability. They have been able to evade law enforcement due to their powerful allies within CircuitBreak. As a result, the Arclight Tribune is offering a bounty of 100,000 Eddies for information leading to Doll Scott's capture or 250,000 Eddies for their arrest and extradition to the authorities.

My source has provided me with an encrypted address where Doll Scott is believed to frequent. I have included the decryption key in this message. Please be cautious when approaching this individual as they are known to be well-connected and highly dangerous.

Best of luck,
Robert Turner
