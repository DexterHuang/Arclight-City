*Location: Gang Stronghold, Downtown Arclight City*

In the dimly lit hallway of the gang stronghold, two figures could be seen arguing intensely. One figure, dressed in a sleek black suit and sunglasses, held a pistol pointed at another man's head. Despite being threatened, the second man remained defiant, shouting something about betrayal and loyalty. Suddenly, without warning, the gunman pulled the trigger, sending a deafening boom echoing throughout the building. Blood splattered against the walls as the victim collapsed onto the ground, lifeless.

Without showing any remorse or emotion, the gunman calmly walked away from the scene while wiping off his gloved hand on his pants. His steps were quick and determined, suggesting that he had somewhere important to be. As he disappeared around the corner, silence once again fell upon the eerie hallways of the gang stronghold.

This incident serves as a stark reminder of how brutal and unforgiving life can be in Arclight City â€“ especially when dealing with its ruthless underworld elements. It remains unclear why this particular dispute escalated into murder, but one thing is certain: violence seems to be an everyday occurrence here.
