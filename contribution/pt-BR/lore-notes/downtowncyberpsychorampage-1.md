>**Arclight Times Exclusive: CircuitBreak Neutralizes Rampaging Cyberpsycho in Downtown Sector**

>By Jack Jackson 

>Downtown Arclight was plunged into chaos last night as a heavily augmented individual, exhibiting clear signs of cyberpsychosis, went on a violent rampage. Witnesses described the attacker as a hulking figure with glowing red eyes and razor-sharp cybernetic limbs. The individual, seemingly impervious to conventional weaponry, wreaked havoc on several city blocks, leaving behind a trail of destruction and fear.

>The Arclight City Police Department (ACPD) initially responded but was quickly overwhelmed by the cyberpsycho's ferocity. Several officers sustained serious injuries before being forced to retreat.  A chilling video circulating online shows ACPD units desperately trying to contain the attacker, only to be tossed aside like rag dolls. 

>Fortunately, the situation was ultimately brought under control by CircuitBreak, a private security firm notorious for its ruthless methods. Sources within CircuitBreak confirm that a specialized team equipped with experimental weaponry and cybernetic countermeasures was dispatched to neutralize the threat. The operation reportedly involved a high-intensity firefight that lasted several hours before the cyberpsycho was finally subdued.

>The incident has raised serious questions about the ACPD's ability to handle escalating cyberpsycho threats and the growing reliance on private security firms for public safety. 

>Mayor Anya Petrova issued a statement expressing her "deep concern" over the attack and pledged to review security protocols. However, many citizens remain skeptical, demanding concrete action to address the city's burgeoning cyberpsycho problem.

>The identity of the cyberpsycho remains unknown, and authorities are currently investigating potential motives behind the rampage.
