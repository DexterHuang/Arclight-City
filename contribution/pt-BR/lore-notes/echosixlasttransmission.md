*You found a battered cyberdeck tucked under a pile of discarded datapads and stim packs. It's still warm to the touch, as if recently used. A single file, titled "Last Transmission," blinks on the screen. Curiosity piqued, you open it.*

> **Transmission initiated. Subject: Glitch. Location: Construct 743. Status: Critical.** 

> This is Echo Six, signing off. Or maybe signing in, depending on how this goes.  I should have known better than to take this gig. "Simple data extraction" they said. "Low risk, high reward."  Yeah, right. Turns out the target was a backdoor into some mega-corp's R&D, and now I'm stuck in a collapsing virtual reality nightmare.

> The Construct is imploding around me. Code cascading, firewalls flaring, security programs turning hostile. My firewall's holding, barely, but the bleedthrough is getting worse.  I can feel it eating at my neural pathways, like digital acid. 

> I tried to jack out, but the exit point's gone offline. They're purging the construct, trying to erase everything.  I'm trapped.  This is probably my last transmission. If anyone finds this, tell them...tell them Glitch was right. This city's a meat grinder, and they chew up netrunners like cheap cyberware.

> Sorry, choom. I didn't mean to get you involved. 

> **Transmission terminated.**
