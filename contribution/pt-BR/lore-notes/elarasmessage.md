You found an old, crumpled datapad tucked behind a loose panel in the wall. It's dusty and worn, but still functional. As you power it on, a single image flickers to life - a faded photograph of a young woman with bright eyes and a mischievous smile, standing next to a man with a kind face and calloused hands. A handwritten note appears below the picture, its ink smudged by time and tears:

> **For my choom, if you ever find this...** 

> It's me, Elara. I know they say the CircuitBreak tower justâ€¦collapsed. That a faulty reactor caused it. Lies. They don't want you to know what really happened that day. Not about the black market nuke, not about the screams, not about how many good people were vaporized in an instant. 

> My husband, Marcus, he was working security detail there. Said he had a feeling something was off, but they wouldn't listen. He told me to stay away, that it wasn't safe. I should have listened.

> They took him from me, along with so many others.  They call it an accident. They call it collateral damage. But I know the truth. And I won't let them bury it. 

> If you find this, choom, pleaseâ€¦remember us. Remember Marcus. Remember all those who died that day. Don't let their sacrifice be in vain.

> Elara
