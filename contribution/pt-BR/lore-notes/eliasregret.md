*You stumble upon a small, battered datapad tucked inside a dusty locker.  It’s cracked and scratched, but still faintly humming with residual power. You manage to power it up, and a single file appears on the screen: "Regret." Curious, you open it.* 


> **From:** Elias Vance
> **To:** No One (But maybe someone will find this)
> **Date:** 2082/10/17

> It’s been five days. Five days since they wiped the slate clean. They said it would be for the best, that I wouldn't remember the bad things anymore. That I could start fresh. But… there are cracks in the new me. Fragments. Shadows flitting at the edge of my awareness. 

> I can’t shake this feeling of loss, like a part of myself is missing. A name whispers on the wind, just out of reach.  A face flashes before my eyes, beautiful and familiar, but gone in an instant. Was it a lover? A friend? A family member? I don't know. All I have are these agonizing glimpses, these phantom echoes of something precious lost.

> They promised oblivion, but they gave me this instead – a hollow shell haunted by ghosts.  I thought I wanted to forget, but now I crave those memories, even the painful ones. They were mine. They defined me. Now I’m just… empty. 

> Maybe someone will find this. Maybe someone who knows what happened to me. Maybe someone who can help me piece myself back together. But if not…  if no one remembers Elias Vance, then maybe the best thing is to let these fragments fade away. Let the darkness consume me completely. At least then, there would be peace.
