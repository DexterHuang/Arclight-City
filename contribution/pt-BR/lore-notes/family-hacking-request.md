Hey guys, I am reaching out to anyone who can hear me. My brother just got himself into some serious trouble with the wrong crowd. He owes money to CircuitBreak after taking a job without knowing its consequences. Now they are coming after him hardcore. If anyone can help me find information about CircuitBreak or maybe even take them down a notch, I would be forever grateful. Please respond ASAP.

Sincerely,
Selie Lopez
