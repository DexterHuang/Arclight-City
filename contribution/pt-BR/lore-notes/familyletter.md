As you rummage through the debris of the enemy stronghold, your eyes catch sight of a small, blood-stained note lying next to a lifeless body. You hesitantly pick it up and read:

> Dear family,
> 
> If you're reading this, then I must have failed to make it out alive. I want you to know that I love you all more than anything in this world, and I am so proud of the lives each of you has built for yourselves.
> 
> Life in Arclight City was hard, but we always managed to find a way to survive. The gang life was never easy, but it was the only thing that could provide for our family's needs. I hope you understand that my decisions were made out of love and necessity.
> 
> As you continue on without me, remember to stay strong and look out for one another. We have always been a tight-knit family, and I know that will never change. Keep each other close and hold onto the memories we've shared together.
> 
> Please don't mourn my passing too long, though. I want you all to live your lives to the fullest, even without me by your side. Embrace the Arclight-dream and chase after your own dreams with passion and determination.
> 
> Take care of our dear mother for me, she needs someone to look out for her now more than ever. And don't forget about little sister; make sure she stays away from trouble and focuses on her studies.
> 
> Lastly, I want you all to know that I am at peace with my decision. This life of crime was never meant for us, but it was the only way we could survive in this city. Now, as I leave this world, I hope that you can find a better path for yourselves - one that's free from violence and danger.
> 
> I love you all more than words can express. Stay safe, and remember me fondly.
> 
> With all my love,
> 
> Your father (or brother/lover)
