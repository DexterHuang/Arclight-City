>Dear Journal,

>Today I saw her again... That woman with the fierce red hair and piercing green eyes. She walks around the shop like she owns the place, checking every single weapon on display as if searching for something specific. Her presence alone fills me with both fear and excitement – fear because I don't want to cross paths with someone so dangerous looking, but excitement because deep down inside, I can tell there's more to her than meets the eye.

>Her reputation precedes her after all; everyone knows about Maxine's Weapon Smith Store being run by none other than 'Red', an ex-mercenary turned arms dealer who isn't afraid to get her hands dirty when necessary. But despite knowing all these stories about her past life as a killer-for-hire, something about her captivates me completely. Maybe it's just my fascination with danger or maybe there really is more depth hidden beneath that tough exterior... Whatever it may be though, one thing remains certain – I wish we could chat sometime over drinks at The Red Bar like normal people instead of keeping our distance due to our respective roles within this twisted society we call home.

>Until then,
