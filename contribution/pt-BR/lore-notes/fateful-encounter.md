As you were looting the stronghold, you noticed a cyberdeck on a table, with a message open. You decided to take a look.

> Dear Friend,

> I hope this message finds you well. My name is Morganica Rodriguez, and I am a RipperDoc working out of Arclight City. As a person who deals with the damaged and the disfigured, I have seen more than my fair share of violence and pain in this city. But tonight, I had an encounter that has left me shaken to my core.
> 
> I was on my way home from a long day at the clinic when I stumbled upon a group of mercenaries outside the Red Bar. They were arguing with a mysterious figure who went by the name Zero Byte. The hacker seemed lost and disoriented, but there was something about them that caught my attention. Perhaps it was the determination in their eyes or the way they spoke about the corruption in this city.
> 
> As I watched from the shadows, the mercenaries threatened to harm Zero Byte if they didn't leave town immediately. The hacker hesitated for a moment before agreeing to go. But as they walked away, I couldn't shake the feeling that I had just witnessed something significant. Something that could change the course of this city forever.
> 
> I have no idea who you are or how you found this message, but if you ever come across Zero Byte again, please tell them to stay strong and keep fighting for what they believe in. This city needs more people like them.
> 
> Yours truly,
> Morganica Rodriguez
