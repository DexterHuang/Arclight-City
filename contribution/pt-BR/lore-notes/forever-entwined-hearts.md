My Dearest Choombah,

By now, you must know that our love cannot be. Our paths diverge too greatly, and the forces that seek to keep us apart grow stronger every day. But remember, no matter how far we may drift apart, our hearts shall remain forever entwined.

I wish I could hold you once more before I leave this cursed city behind. To feel your warmth against me, to hear your sweet laughter fill the air around us. Alas, fate seems determined to deny us this simple pleasure.

But take solace in knowing that wherever I go, whatever challenges lie ahead, my thoughts will always return to you. And though we may never share another kiss beneath the neon lights of Arclight City, our souls will dance eternally across the stars.

Until then, my dearest Choombah, farewell. May fortune guide your steps and protect your heart.

Yours truly,
Chloe
