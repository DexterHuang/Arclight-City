*You stumbled upon a hidden basement in the gang stronghold while searching for valuables.*

---

*Inside the dimly lit room, you see a man recording himself on a handheld camcorder.*

**Juan Hernandez**: "Hey guys, check this out. I just got promoted to lieutenant in our gang."

*He holds up a crumpled paper with 'Lieutenant' scribbled on it.*

**Juan Hernandez**: "Yeah, we took over another block today. It wasn't easy though. We had to fight against those damned Arclights again."

*He shakes his head in disgust before continuing.*

**Juan Hernandez**: "But hey, we won right? And now we control more territory. Our boss must be proud."

*There's a knock on the door followed by someone entering the room.*

**Unknown Voice**: "Hey Juan, you got a minute?"

*It's one of his subordinates carrying a large duffel bag filled with cash.*

**Subordinate**: "Here's the payment for last night's job. Like you said, we split everything fifty-fifty."

*Juan takes the bag without counting the money inside.*

**Juan Hernandez**: "Thanks man. You know how to treat your lieutenant right."

*They both laugh heartily before the screen goes blank.*

---

*You quickly grab the camcorder and run outside, hoping to escape undetected.*
