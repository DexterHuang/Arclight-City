> Choom, I'm trapped. They've got my family.  They're using them to force me into running dirty jobs for the Crimson Serpents. Every node I crack, every firewall I breach, it tears at my soul. 
> 
> This last gig... they want me to hit TaiXing Cybernetics. It's too risky, too high profile. If they catch me, it's lights out for everyone.  I need someone to pull me out. Someone who can get us both out clean.
>
> I have intel on their operation, on their security protocols, everything.  It's all encrypted, but I know a backdoor, a hidden channel. If you can reach me there, I can give you the goods. 
> 
> Don't hesitate. Time is running out.
