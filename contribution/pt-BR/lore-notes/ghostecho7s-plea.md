> > Subject: Choom, I need your help. It's not safe here. They found my backdoor. My whole life is on the line. I can't get out of this solo. They're making me do things… things I never thought I'd do. Data heists, corporate sabotage... I'm losing myself. 

> > Remember that time we cracked TaiXing's firewall together? You said I had a knack for it. You were right. But now they're using my talent against me. Blackmail, threats… They got to my family. I can't risk them getting hurt. 

> > There's gotta be a way out. Maybe you know someone, some fixer who deals with this kind of mess? Someone who can get me clean, make this nightmare disappear.  I have intel on their operation, juicy stuff they wouldn't want leaked. I can give it to you, anonymously, if you can just help me get out of this. 

> > Meet me at the usual spot, by the old data spire near Voidtown. Midnight. Bring a burner deck, no trace. This is my last shot.
