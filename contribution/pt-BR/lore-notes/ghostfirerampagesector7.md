*You rummage through a desk drawer, half-expecting to find nothing but empty packs of synth-cigarettes and discarded datapads. Instead, your fingers brush against something stiff and papery. It’s a battered notebook, its cover cracked and faded. You flip it open, revealing hastily scribbled notes and underlined passages. A single sheet falls free, bearing the stark title: “Cyberpsycho Rampage - Sector 7.”  You pick it up, intrigued.*

**Cyberpsycho Rampage - Sector 7**

**By: Jack Jackson, Arclight Times**

The normally bustling streets of Sector 7 were transformed into a hellscape last night as a cyberpsycho, codenamed "Ghostfire" by witnesses, went on a rampage.  Reports started flooding in around midnight - a figure clad in twisted chrome and flickering neon, wielding an arsenal of makeshift weaponry cobbled together from scrap metal and repurposed cybernetics. The creature moved with inhuman speed and ferocity, leaving a trail of carnage in its wake. Witnesses described it as a grotesque parody of humanity, eyes glowing an eerie crimson, limbs contorted at unnatural angles. 

The ACPD was slow to respond, predictably overwhelmed by the sheer brutality of the attack.  Bystanders scattered, seeking refuge in darkened alleys and boarded-up shops.  Several attempts by patrol units were met with swift and brutal counterattacks. The Ghostfire seemed impervious to conventional weaponry, shrugging off bullets and energy blasts with chilling indifference. 

It was CircuitBreak that finally brought the nightmare to an end. A heavily armed team of their elite mercenaries stormed into the chaos, utilizing specialized weaponry designed to neutralize cyberpsychos.  The ensuing firefight was brief but intense, a symphony of laser fire and shattering metal. Finally, with a deafening explosion, Ghostfire collapsed, its chrome shell shattered, its crimson eyes extinguished forever.

Sector 7 remains in lockdown today as forensic teams comb through the wreckage. The official death toll stands at 17, with dozens more injured. This latest incident serves as a grim reminder of the ever-present threat posed by cyberpsychos, and the limitations of our current law enforcement agencies in dealing with this growing epidemic.

This city needs better protection. It needs CircuitBreak, not the ACPD.
