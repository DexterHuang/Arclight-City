*You stumble upon a hidden compartment behind a flickering holographic advertisement for some dubious cybernetic enhancement. Inside, nestled amongst discarded data chips and empty stim packs, you find a battered datapad. It's unlocked, and a single file pulses with an insistent red light. Curiosity piqued, you open it.*

> Choom, I need your help. This ain't a gig, this is a goddamn life-or-death situation. They got me cornered.  They've got my family, they're breathing down my neck, pushing me into jobs I can't stomach. They say if I don't comply, they'll make sure my loved ones "disappear" permanently. 
> 
> I'm talking about high-level corporate espionage, data theft you wouldn't believe. Stuff that could bring down entire sectors. I'm drowning in code, running blind, and every line I type feels like a betrayal. My soul is bleeding out with every byte I siphon.
>
> I know this sounds crazy, but I can't go on like this.  I need an extraction, a way out. I've got intel on their operation, enough to bring them crashing down. But I need someone I can trust, someone who won't hesitate to pull the trigger when it's time. Someone like you.
> 
> Meet me at the usual spot. Midnight tonight. Come alone. Don't bring any choom. This is a solo job, and my life depends on it.

> **Ghostfire out.**
