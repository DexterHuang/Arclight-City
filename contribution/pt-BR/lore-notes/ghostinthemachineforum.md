You found an old datapad tucked under a loose floorboard. It’s cracked and dusty, but still functional. The screen flickers to life, revealing a forum thread titled “**Ghost in the Machine - Sharing Our Scars**.”

Ever since the Breach, I can’t trust anything plugged into my brain. Even basic comms feel invasive now. Anyone else getting these phantom sensations?

Some of us might need full implant replacements, but that’s risky. Who knows what else could go wrong? I’m stuck in this limbo, haunted by the ghosts in my own head.

You close the datapad, feeling a chill run down your spine. The words echo in your mind, a stark reminder of the fragile nature of trust and technology in this unforgiving city.
