> **Subject: Ghost Protocol - Extraction Needed**

> Choom, if you're reading this, I'm in deep shit. The Razorbacks have got me cornered, using my skills to do their dirty work. They threatened my family, said they'd "repurpose" them if I didn't comply.  I'm running ghost protocols now, but it's only a matter of time before they crack it. 

> My name is Kai, and I used to be a freelance netrunner, clean runs, no blood on my hands. Now, I'm forced to siphon funds from MegaEstate, cripple TaiXing's security systems, even dig through Trauma Team's patient records - things I swore I'd never do.

>  I need out.  I need someone who can break the Razorbacks' hold on me. Someone who knows how to navigate the Net like I do, someone who can pull me out of this digital hellhole before they silence me permanently. 

> Look for the encrypted file attached - it contains intel on their operation, their weak points, everything I could salvage. Use it, choom. Help me get my life back.  Help me save my family.
