**CYBERPSYCHO RAMPAGE ROCKS MEGA ESTATE DISTRICT!**

***

> **By Jack Jackson, Arclight Times**

> The Mega Estate District was plunged into chaos last night as a rogue cyberpsycho, codenamed "Ghostwalker" by witnesses, unleashed a brutal rampage. Eyewitnesses describe the assailant as a hulking figure clad in scavenged armor, augmented with glowing red cybernetics that pulsed ominously. He wielded a pair of electrified blades, leaving a trail of carnage through upscale residential blocks. 

> Initial reports indicated a security breach at a TaiXing Cybernetic facility, where Ghostwalker allegedly acquired his lethal augmentations. The Arclight City Police Department (ACPD) was slow to respond, overwhelmed by the sheer ferocity of the attack.  Multiple patrol units were ambushed and neutralized before reinforcements could arrive.

> "It was like something out of a nightmare," recounted one terrified resident, who requested anonymity. "He moved with inhuman speed, slicing through security drones like paper. The screams... I'll never forget the screams." 

> Thankfully, CircuitBreak Security, known for their swift and ruthless tactics, intervened before the situation escalated further.  A heavily armed team descended upon the scene, engaging Ghostwalker in a brutal firefight that lasted for over an hour. Finally, after a hail of bullets and specialized EMP blasts, the cyberpsycho was neutralized. 

> The aftermath was devastating. Numerous high-rise buildings sustained significant damage, luxury vehicles were reduced to smoldering wrecks, and several civilians lost their lives.  The ACPD has launched an investigation into the security breach at TaiXing Cybernetic and the circumstances surrounding Ghostwalker's rampage. Meanwhile, CircuitBreak remains tight-lipped about their involvement, citing ongoing operations.

> This latest incident serves as a chilling reminder of the ever-present danger posed by cyberpsychos in Arclight City. As technology advances and cybernetics become increasingly commonplace, the line between human and machine blurs, leaving society vulnerable to those who succumb to the dark side of augmentation.
