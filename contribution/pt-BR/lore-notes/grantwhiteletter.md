You stumbled upon an old storage room, filled with dusty boxes and crumbling shelves. As you sifted through the clutter, your eyes caught something unusual: a tattered envelope, partially hidden behind a stack of books. With curiosity piquing, you carefully picked it up, noting the faded handwriting on the front.

Dear Maxine,

I hope this letter finds you well. It's been too long since I last saw your face, and I miss you more than words can express. Every day without you feels like a lifetime, and each night I find myself drifting off to sleep with thoughts of you in my mind.

You know how much this life has consumed us both, Maxine. We've traded quiet nights under the stars for the deafening chaos of gunfire, and stolen moments of passion for cold steel and bitter betrayals. But even amidst all this violence and despair, I hold onto the memory of your smile, the warmth of your touch, and the love we once shared.

I fear that our paths have diverged too far now, and there may be no turning back. CircuitBreak's grip on me grows tighter every day, while you continue to forge your own path in this treacherous city. But know this: no matter where life takes us or what challenges we face, my heart will always belong to you.

I dream of a time when we can escape this madness together, find solace in each other's arms, and build a future free from the shadows of our pasts. Until then, I will hold onto hope and cherish every memory we have shared.

Please stay safe out there, Maxine. Keep your head down and your wits about you. And remember that no matter how far apart we may be, my love for you remains as strong as ever.

Yours forever,

Grant White
