*You come across an old, dusty recorder lying on the floor. As you pick it up, you see a small red button on top of it. You press it, and the recording begins.*

**Zero Byte (Voiceover)**: "Hello... if you're listening to this, then I must have failed in my mission. My name is Zero Byte, and I am a hacker for hire. There's someone out there who wants me dead, and they've hired CircuitBreak to do the job. But I won't go down without a fight."

*The recording pauses briefly.*

**Zero Byte (Voiceover)**: "I've been working on something big, something that could change the world as we know it. It's called 'The Great Equalizer', and it has the potential to level the playing field between the rich and the poor, the powerful and the weak. But some people don't want that."

*There is a soft, metallic sound in the background.*

**Zero Byte (Voiceover)**: "I've been hiding out in this old warehouse for weeks now, working on The Great Equalizer. I know it's risky, but I can't let them stop me. Not when the fate of millions is at stake."

*The recording starts to crackle.*

**Zero Byte (Voiceover)**: "If you find this, please promise me that you'll finish what I started. The world needs The Great Equalizer, and I can't do it alone."

*A sudden burst of static fills the air before the recording ends abruptly.*
