*You stumble upon an old audio recorder on a desk, its surface covered with grease and fingerprints. You press play.*

**Brayden Sanchez**: "Hey there, it's me again, Brayden. I just can't keep this stuff to myself! So, today, I discovered the most fascinating thing while working on my latest implant prototype. You know those cute little bio-bots we use for cleaning? Well, guess what they can do now! *laughs*

I accidentally spilled a whole vat of superconducting nanofluid all over one of them, and boom! The little guy started glowing like a Christmas tree. Turns out, the fluid gives 'em some serious cyber-enhancements. Now they can hack into any security system, just by sniffing around for a few minutes! I call them... *drumroll* ...HackBots!

But hey, don't tell anyone about this yet, okay? I still need to perfect the process and, you know, avoid any explosions. Just imagine the potential though: HackBots swarming through security systems like a digital locust plague! *laughs*

Oh, and I almost forgot - I've been meaning to ask, do you guys want in on this? We could start our own little side business, make some serious netcoins. Think about it, and let me know.

Until next time, Brayden out."
