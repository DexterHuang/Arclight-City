Dear Lilith,

I know I shouldn't be writing this letter, but I just can't help myself. Every time I see you in the Red Bar with your sleek looking full-body cyberwear and that cute, cheery personality of yours, my heart skips a beat. You are truly one of a kind, Lilith.

I don't know if you ever get bored of being admired by everyone around you or not, but I hope this letter finds its way to your beautiful eyes and warms your lonely heart even for just a moment. Maybe someday we can share a drink together at the Red Bar and talk about our dreams and aspirations like normal people do.

Until then, take care of yourself, my dear Lilith. You deserve all the happiness in the world.

Sincerely yours,
Eolande Lewis
