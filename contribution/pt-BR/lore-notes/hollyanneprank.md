As you sifted through the crumpled-up notes scattered across the gang stronghold floor, one caught your eye. The handwriting was messy but legible, and the scent of stale cigarettes clung to the paper. You unfolded it carefully, revealing a tale of a prank gone wrong.

*Dear Choomba,*

*I know what we are going to do for Hollyanne's Arclight-birthday is going to be amazing! We are going to make her think she is in a movie!*

*Here's the plan:*

*1. Austine and Mabel, you two are going to dress up as bodyguards and follow her around town.*

*2. I will hack into the traffic lights and make them change color randomly so that it looks like a chase scene.*

*3. We'll get some of our Choomba friends to dress up as extras and scatter them around Arclight City, pretending to be shocked or running away from "the action".*

*4. Then, we'll set up a small explosion at the Red Bar just as she walks in for her usual hangout spot. We'll make sure nobody gets hurt, of course.*

*5. Finally, we'll have our "leading man" swoop in and save her, all while filming it with a drone for the perfect Hollywood finish.*

*I know it sounds crazy, but I think this is going to be the ultimate Arclight City prank! Can't wait to see Hollyanne's face when she realizes it's all for her birthday!*

*Stay cyber, Choomba,*
