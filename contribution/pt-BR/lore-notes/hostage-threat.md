*On the screen, Edie Stewart appears, looking terrified.*

**Edie Stewart**: "I don't know what to do! Please help me!"

---

*She starts crying uncontrollably, wiping tears away from her face.*

**Edie Stewart**: "They said they would kill me if I didn't tell them about the meeting."

---

*Her voice shakes as she continues speaking.*

**Edie Stewart**: "It was supposed to be just a normal gathering at the community center, but then these guys showed up..."

---

*She takes a deep breath before continuing.*

**Edie Stewart**: "They had guns and masks, they told everyone to stay quiet or else they would shoot us all."

---

*Tears stream down her cheeks again as she relives the horrifying moment.*

**Edie Stewart**: "I couldn't let them hurt anyone else, so I gave them the information they wanted."

---

*She looks directly into the camera, pleading for understanding.*

**Edie Stewart**: "Please, please don't let them come after me. I'm sorry for what I did, but I was afraid."

---

*With a heavy heart, she signs off the call, leaving behind a trail of sorrow and regret.*
