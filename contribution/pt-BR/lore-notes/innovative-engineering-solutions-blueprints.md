> Blueprint for "Titanium Fiber Muscle Augmentation" by Dr. Oriana

This detailed schematic outlines the process of implanting titanium fibers into muscles to increase strength and endurance. The procedure is complex, requiring advanced cybernetic surgery techniques developed by renowned RipperDoc, Dr. Oriana. However, for those willing to undergo such an enhancement, it promises significant improvements in physical capabilities.

> Blueprint for "Quantum Encryption Module" by Zero Byte

This highly classified schematic was allegedly created by the elusive hacker known as Zero Byte. It details a quantum encryption module that can securely transmit data over long distances without fear of interception or decryption. The technology is still in its early stages, but if successfully implemented, it could revolutionize communication security across Arclight City and beyond.

> Blueprint for "Solar-Powered Smart Fabric" by Roslyn Jackson

Roslyn Jackson, a talented textile engineer, has designed these blueprints for solar-powered smart fabric. The material can harness energy from the sun to power small electronic devices embedded within clothing. This innovation could lead to self-sufficient wearable tech and reduce reliance on batteries or external charging sources.
