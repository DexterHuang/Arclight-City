You rummage through a dusty locker, your fingers brushing against worn leather and cold metal. Inside, you find a battered datapad, its screen cracked but still faintly glowing. Curiosity piqued, you slide it open. A holographic image flickers to life, revealing a gaunt, scarred face framed by thinning hair. The man's cybernetic eye, a gleaming emerald orb, stares directly at you, a hint of sadness in its artificial gaze.

> They say every fighter has one last fight left in them.  Maybe that's true. But for me, the bell's tolled. This ain't a victory speech, more like a goodbye note. You see this eye? Used to track punches faster than a viper strike. Now it aches like hellfire. My bones creak like rusty servos. This chrome and fleshâ€¦ it ain't holding up like it used to.

> I was "Ironclad" Jax, the baddest cyborg this side of the Arclight. Used to love the roar of the crowd, the sting of adrenaline, the clang of metal on metal. But somewhere along the line, the thrill faded. Replaced by a dull ache that never sleeps.  
>
> I fought for glory, for Eddies, for the rush. Now I just fight to keep the damn lights on, to outrun the ghosts in my head.  They whisper of shattered dreams and broken bodies. They remind me of every punch taken, every blow landed. 
>
> So this is it. No more blood in the ring, no more cybernetic brawls. Just a weary warrior seeking peace. Maybe a quiet corner in a dive bar, a shot of something strong, and a good night's sleep without the nightmares.  
>
> If you find yourself in the Red Bar, raise a glass to Ironclad Jax. One last toast to the fallen champion.
