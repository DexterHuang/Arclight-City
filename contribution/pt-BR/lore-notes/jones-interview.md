Detective Veronica Hart: Good afternoon, Mr. Jones. I appreciate you coming down to the station for this interview.

Lind Jones: Yeah, well, I didn't have much choice, did I? I just want to get home to my wife and kids.

Veronica: We understand your situation, but we need your cooperation to clear things up. Can you tell us where you were on the night of August 2nd?

Lind: I was at the Red Bar with some friends from work. We were just having a few drinks after a long week.

Veronica: And did you see anyone else there that evening? Anyone out of the ordinary, perhaps?

Lind: There was this guy, he seemed kinda sketchy to me. I don't remember his name, but he had some crazy cyberwear on his arms. He kept staring at us like he wanted a fight or something.

Veronica: Describe this man for me. What did he look like?

Lind: Well, he was tall, about six feet, and really muscular. Had this slicked-back blonde hair and a goatee. He was wearing a black leather jacket with some kind of logo on the back. Oh, and those cyber arms I mentioned earlier, they were covered in all sorts of gadgets and weapons.

Veronica: Did he approach you or your friends at any point?

Lind: Not that night, but we did see him again a few days later. He was with some other guys, and they tried to rob us on our way home from work. We managed to get away, though.

Veronica: And do you know who this man is or what he might be involved in?

Lind: No idea, but I've heard rumors about a group of mercenaries causing trouble around the city lately. Maybe they're connected somehow?

Veronica: Thank you for your information, Mr. Jones. We will look into this and get back to you as soon as possible.
