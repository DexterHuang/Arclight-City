*You find a battered cyberdeck tucked beneath a pile of discarded synth-skin clothing. It's still warm, humming faintly with residual energy.  A single file is open on its screen, labeled "Final Transmission." You hesitate for a moment, then decide to access it.* 

---

> **Transmission initiated. Target: Unknown. Encryption: High. Subject: Requiem for a Netrunner.**

> *Static crackles, followed by a distorted voice, barely audible over the whine of failing processors.* 

> "This is... Kai. My last transmission. The construct is collapsing around me. I can feel it, the code unraveling, the threads fraying. I'm trapped.  Tried to fight my way out, but it's a losing battle. This ain't no ordinary firewall, choom. It's a goddamn singularity, consuming everything in its path."

> *A ragged cough echoes through the speakers.* 

> "Zero Byte warned me about this place. Said it was a death trap. Shoulda listened. Shoulda stayed offline. Now I'm paying the price.  The whispers... they're getting louder. The code is bleeding into my mind, twisting my thoughts, blurring the lines between reality and the matrix."

> *A high-pitched whine rises in volume, drowning out Kai's voice for a moment.* 

> "Damn it... losing control... gotta focus...  Just wanted one last score. One last taste of the digital feast. Now I'm gonna be another ghost in the machine, another forgotten data point. Farewell, choom. May your runs be clean and your exits swift."

> *The transmission abruptly cuts out, replaced by a cacophony of digital static and the chilling hum of dying circuitry.*
