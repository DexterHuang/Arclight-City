*You found a battered cyberdeck tucked beneath a pile of discarded data chips and ripped circuit boards. A faint blue glow emanates from its cracked screen, flickering erratically as if struggling to stay alive. Curiosity piqued, you carefully lift the deck, noticing a single file labeled "Final Transmission" open on its display.*

> *Damn it. This thing's falling apart faster than I can patch it. The bleedthrough is getting worse. Seeing things… fragments of code, twisted realities bleeding into this construct. They must have overloaded the firewall, trying to trap me in here. Typical Snakeskin tactics.*
>
> *I thought I could slip past their defenses, grab that intel on their new shipment route, and be out before they even knew I was in. But they’ve got eyes everywhere, always watching. Always anticipating. Underestimated them, just like everyone else does.*
>
> *This message is a long shot. If anyone's listening, if this thing manages to send, know this: Snakeskin is moving something big, something dangerous. They're using the old docks, under cover of night, three days from now. Don't let them get away with it.*
>
> *The code’s getting louder now, a chorus of whispers… I can’t hold on much longer. The construct is fracturing around me. My connection's fading…* 
>
> *Goodbye, choom. May the Ghost in the Machine have mercy on us all.*
