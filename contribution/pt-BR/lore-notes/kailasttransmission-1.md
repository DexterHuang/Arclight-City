*You find a battered cyberdeck tucked away beneath a pile of discarded data chips. It's still warm to the touch, as if recently used. A faint blue glow emanates from its screen, flickering erratically. Curiosity piqued, you cautiously approach and notice a single file labeled "Last Transmission" open on the desktop.*

> *Static crackles through the audio feed. A raspy voice, laced with panic, cuts through the digital hiss.*

> "Echo... Echo... can anyone hear me? This is Kai. I'm trapped. Deep inside this damn construct. The whole damn thing's collapsing around me. Glitches are everywhere, reality's warping like a bad trip. I tried to jack out, but the node's fried.  System's locking down. Can't get a signal out."

> *A choked sob pierces through the static. Kai's voice becomes strained, desperate.*

> "I thought I was careful. Thought I knew this code inside and out. But this...this is different. It's like it's sentient, fighting back. Clawing at my mind, trying to pull me in. Can't... can't hold on much longer. The edges are blurring..."

> *The audio feed distorts, punctuated by screeching digital screams and the grinding of code. Then, silence. Only the faint hum of the dying cyberdeck remains.*
