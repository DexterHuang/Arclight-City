*You stumble upon a flickering datapad amidst the debris of a ransacked office. It's cracked and scorched, but still faintly humming with residual energy. A single file blinks on its screen, labeled "Last Transmission." Curiosity piqued, you open it.* 

---

> *Static crackles, followed by a distorted voice, ragged with panic.*

> **"This is Kai... damn it, this thing's collapsing. I can't get out. They… they spiked the matrix, overloaded it. It's… it's like being drowned in data."** 

> *The voice stutters, then becomes clearer for a moment.*

> **"Zero Byte... if you're listening... I got what you wanted. The blueprints are burned into my neural net. They're safe. But… but I can't hold on much longer. This construct is imploding. My code… it's fracturing…"**

> *A high-pitched whine rises, drowning out Kai's voice. The image flickers wildly, showing fragmented code cascading across a distorted cityscape. Then, silence.* 

> **"Choom... goodbye..."** 

*The datapad shuts down with a final click, the screen fading to black.*
