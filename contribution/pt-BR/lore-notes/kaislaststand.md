You stumble upon a battered datapad lying amidst shattered furniture and flickering neon signs. It’s still warm to the touch, suggesting it was recently used. Curiosity piqued, you pick it up and swipe through the interface, finding a single audio log labelled "Last Stand." You press play, bracing yourself for what might be a chilling testament to the violence that unfolded here.

*Static crackles, followed by ragged breathing.*
**"This is… this is Kai. I'm recording this because… because I don't know if anyone else is alive. The cyberpsycho… it came out of nowhere. One minute we were arguing over a shipment, the next… he just snapped. His eyes, they were glowing red, wires sparking from under his skin. It was like something out of a nightmare."

*A metallic screech pierces the audio, followed by a sickening thud.*
**"He ripped through our guys like they were paper dolls. Cyberblades flashing, augmented limbs smashing bone. I barely managed to dodge his first attack. We tried to fight back, but it was hopeless. He was too fast, too strong. Each blow… each scream… it echoed in this damn place like a death knell."

*The breathing grows more labored, punctuated by whimpers and the distant clang of metal.*
**"I hid under a table, praying he wouldn't find me. I could hear him tearing through the rest of them, his laughter… it wasn't human. It was a grating, mechanical howl. He was enjoying this. He relished the carnage."

*A long, agonizing silence follows. Then, a choked sob.*
**"He found me. I saw his glowing eyes peering down at me, and then… everything went black."**

The audio cuts abruptly, leaving you with a chilling silence. You close the datapad, shaken by the raw terror captured in Kai's final moments. The scene around you seems even more desolate now, a tomb of broken dreams and shattered lives.
