You notice a battered data pad lying amidst scattered weapons and discarded armor. It’s cracked and scorched, but still faintly humming with residual power. Curiosity piqued, you pick it up, brushing away dust and grime. The screen flickers to life, revealing a worn-out holographic interface. A voice log begins, distorted and shaky, emanating from the device.

*The flickering light of a streetlamp casts long shadows across the grimy alleyway. Rain slicks the concrete, reflecting the neon glow of distant billboards.* 

**Kaito Sato:** Choom, this is going south faster than a cyberpsycho on Red Stim. We were supposed to grab some schematics from MegaEstate's server farm, clean and simple. In and out, no collateral damage. But things went sideways real quick. 

*A metallic clang echoes through the recording, followed by a muffled scream.*

**Kaito Sato:**  Those damn security bots went haywire. Started spraying bullets like they were on payday. We took down a few, but then… civilians got caught in the crossfire. Kids, families, just trying to get home from work. I saw one little girl, maybe eight years old, staring at me with those big, terrified eyes…

*Kaito's voice cracks, his breathing ragged.*

**Kaito Sato:** This wasn't part of the deal. We were supposed to be ghosts, not goddamn executioners. Now we’re pinned down, surrounded, and I don't even know if we can get out alive.  

*Static crackles, then silence. The recording abruptly ends.*

You slam the data pad shut, feeling a cold knot tighten in your gut. Kaito Sato's words echo in your mind, a chilling reminder of the human cost of corporate greed and mercenary indifference.
