You stumble upon a battered datapad tucked beneath a loose floorboard. It’s cracked and scorched, but still faintly humming with residual power.  Curious, you swipe it free and manage to coax it to life. A grainy video log flickers to life, the image shaky and distorted. 

***
*A gaunt man with cybernetically enhanced eyes stares directly into the camera, his face etched with fatigue and guilt.* 

**Kaito Tanaka**: "Day 42. Still haven't slept properly since… since it happened.  They said this was a clean op, in and out, no collateral damage. They lied. CircuitBreak always lies. They just want the data, don’t care who gets caught in the crossfire."

*He runs a hand through his greasy hair, eyes flickering with pain.* 

**Kaito Tanaka**: "We were supposed to snag schematics from TaiXing Cybernetics. Easy job, they said. Just disable the security grid, grab the files, and vanish. But things went south fast. The guards reacted… aggressively. I don't know if it was a trap or just bad luck, but we ended up in a firefight. Civilians caught in the middle. Kids, families... I saw one little girl…"

*He chokes back a sob, his voice cracking.* 

**Kaito Tanaka**: "They said I had to prioritize the mission, that lives are just numbers. They offered me credits, promised me a better gig next time. But what good is money when you've seen… when you've done…"

*The image flickers again, the man’s face contorted in anguish.* 

**Kaito Tanaka**: "This isn't what I signed up for. This isn't who I want to be. But I'm trapped. CircuitBreak has leverage, knows things about my past. They'll find me if I try to go rogue. I just… I need to get out. Find a way to make things right."

The video abruptly cuts to static. You stare at the datapad, Kaito’s words echoing in your mind. A cold knot of unease settles in your gut.
