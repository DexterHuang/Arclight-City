*You stumbled upon a hidden laboratory in the gang stronghold, the air thick with the smell of chemicals and disinfectant. Among the rows of workstations, you found a terminal with a cryptic message open.*

`> Lab Notes - Confidential`

*I can't believe what I've been a part of. The project was supposed to be about developing a cure for the latest strain of cyber-encephalitis. But it's all a lie. The real goal is to create a bioengineered pandemic, designed to spread rapidly and infect millions. The corporation wants to profit from the chaos and desperation.*

`I remember Dr. Patel's words: "The key to success lies in the virus's adaptability and transmissibility." He was so proud of himself, but I knew something was off. The more I worked on the project, the more I realized the true horror of what we were creating.`

`The virus is designed to target people with cybernetic implants, exploiting their vulnerabilities. It's a ticking time bomb, waiting to unleash hell on the streets of Arclight City. And we're not just talking about any ordinary implants - we're talking about the high-end, top-of-the-line models that the elites and corporate executives use. The ones who can afford to upgrade their bodies with the latest TaiXing Cybernetic components.`

`I tried to raise concerns, but Dr. Patel just laughed it off, saying that the corporation would never release such a virus. That it was just a "theoretical exercise" in pandemic preparedness. But I know the truth. I've seen the meeting minutes, the memos, the encrypted files. This is a deliberate act of bioterrorism, and I'm complicit in it.`

`I have to get out of here, before it's too late. I have to expose them, but I don't know who to trust. Jack Jackson, the journalist, maybe? Or Hana, the Vtuber? She's always talking about the dark underbelly of Arclight City. Maybe she can help me spread the truth.`

`I'm leaving this note, hoping someone will find it and take action. I'll try to gather evidence, but I need help. Please, if you're reading this, don't let them get away with it. Stop them before it's too late.`

*The terminal beeped, and the message disappeared, leaving you with more questions than answers. What was CircuitBreak planning, and how could you stop them?*
