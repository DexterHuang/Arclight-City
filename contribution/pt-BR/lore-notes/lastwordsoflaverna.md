As you rummaged through the debris of the stronghold, your eyes caught a glimpse of an old, worn-out journal lying on top of a pile of documents. You picked it up and opened it, revealing a hastily scrawled note. Your heart skipped a beat as you realized the gravity of the situation.

Dear Family,

I hope this finds you well. I never thought I'd be writing this, but here I am, with my life hanging by a thread. The fight was intense - bullets flying, screams echoing through the air. It all happened so fast. One moment, I was standing tall, and the next, I felt a searing pain in my chest.

I know you've always been worried about my line of work, but I wanted to provide for us. As a mercenary, I've seen things that would make your skin crawl. But every time I thought about giving it up, I'd think of our little ones and how they depend on me.

I never wanted to leave you like this. Please don't mourn for long, though. Life in Arclight City is hard, but we've always been strong together. Keep fighting, keep striving, and never lose faith in each other.

Take care of [Javier Adams/Jason Phillips/Louisa Sanchez] for me, will you? They're like family to us, and I know they'll be there for you when you need them the most.

I wish I could see our children grow up, watch them chase their dreams in this crazy city. But if my time is up, know that I love you all more than words can express. Be proud of who you are, and don't let anyone tell you otherwise.

Stay strong, my loves. I'll be watching over you from above.

With all my heart,
Laverna Brown
