**Found in a dusty, worn-out laptop in a hidden compartment of the stronghold**

*You boot up the old laptop, and a file on the desktop catches your attention. It's personal letter, written in a solemn tone

`>From: Queenie Campbell, akaThe Iron Maiden"`

`>Date: 2085/215`

`>To Whom It May`

I'm writing this to whoever finds. Maybe it'll be a fellow merc, maybe it'll be some nosy cop trying to snoop on my business. Either way, I don't care. I've got nothing left to lose.

I used to be Queenie Campbell, the Iron Maiden. The greatest cybernetic prizefighter this side of the Arclight City limits. I fought in the underground circuits, taking on all comers and raking in the NetCoins. I was a legend in my own right, with cyberlimbs that could crush a human skull like an eggshell and reflexes fast enough to dodge a bullet.

But it all came at a cost.

The augmentations, the implants, the constant upgrades – they took their toll. My body's a mess of wires and synthetic tissue. My mind's a jumble of memories and pain. I've got more scars than a street doc's got tricks up their sleeve.

And for what? So I could be a spectacle, a sideshow freak for the gangs and corps to gawk at? So I could be a tool, a weapon to be used and discarded when I'm no longer useful?

I've lost count of the number of times I've had to replace my eyes, my limbs, my organs. I've lost count of the number of times I've woken up in a cold sweat, wondering who I am, what I've become.

I'm done.

I'm retiring, effective immediately. I'm hanging up my gloves, selling my cyberwear, and getting out of this damn city. I'm going to find some quiet little hole in the wall where I can live out the rest of my days in peace.

If you're reading this, and you're thinking of following in my footsteps, don't. Don't do it. The fame, the fortune – it's not worth it. The pain, the suffering, the constant fear of losing yourself in the process – it's not worth it.

I've seen the worst of humanity, and I've been the worst of humanity. I've seen the beauty of Arclight City, and I've seen the ugliness that lurks beneath.

Get out while you still can.

Queenie Campbell, aka "The Iron Maiden"

*As you finish reading the letter, you can't help but feel a sense of unease. The life of a merc is a hard one, and Queenie's story is a harsh reminder of the costs that come with living on the edge.*
