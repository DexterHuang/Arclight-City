You come across a small, tattered envelope on the floor of the hostile stronghold. It's addressed to "Daddy." You pick it up and open it carefully, revealing a handwritten note inside.

> Dear Daddy,
> 
> I miss you so much! It's been three months since you left for your last gig with your crew from the Red Bar. Mom says it's dangerous out there, but I know you're the best mercenary in Arclight City. Please come home soon.
> 
> I wanted to ask if you could bring me back a gift when you return. There's this cool cyberwear shop in downtown that has a new type of cyber-eye that can zoom in really far, just like your scope on your sniper rifle! Can you get it for me? Please say yes!
> 
> I also wanted to ask for a bedtime story. You always told the best stories about your adventures and the gangs you've taken down. Tell me one more time about the time you infiltrated CircuitBreak's headquarters and took down their top hitman. That was so cool!
> 
> I love you, Daddy. Please come home soon. Missing you every day.
> 
> Love,
> [your child's name]
