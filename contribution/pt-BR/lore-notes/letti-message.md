As you were looting the stronghold, you noticed a cyberdeck on a table, with a message open.

> *Hey Arthur,*

> I hope this message finds you well. It's been quite some time since we last met in that Red Bar, but I couldn't help but think of you when I stumbled upon this piece of information. You know how much I value our friendship and trust between us. This could be a life-changing opportunity for both of us, so I thought it was only fair to share it with you first.

> *As you may recall,* the Whisperer mentioned that she's been keeping an eye on CircuitBreak's latest hitman operation. They've been planning something big, but the details are still sketchy. She let me know that they're looking for a few more mercenaries to join their crew and help pull off this mysterious job. I believe it might be worth our time to inquire further about it.
>
> *Here's what I found:* CircuitBreak has been negotiating with MegaEstate regarding some high-profile security contracts. It seems like the target is one of those elitist parties hosted by the mega corporation, which could mean a fat paycheck for whoever successfully completes the mission.
>
> *Now,* I know you're not one to get involved in shady business, but consider this: if we can find out more about CircuitBreak's operation and their target, we might be able to beat them to the punch and claim the prize for ourselves. After all, knowledge is power, right?
>
> *So,* what do you say, Arthur? Are you up for a little adventure with your old friend Letti? Let me know if you need any more information or assistance. I'm always here for you, buddy.
>
> *Take care and stay safe out there.*
