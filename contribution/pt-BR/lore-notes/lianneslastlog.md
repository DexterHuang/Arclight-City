You found a battered cyberdeck tucked beneath a pile of discarded datapads and stim packs. A faint hum emanated from it, even though the power source was clearly dead.

**Lianne Martin**: "This...this is Lianne. Last log entry. I'm trapped. Deep inside the Construct. They...they rigged it. Said it was a simple data grab, but this...this is something else. A nightmare."

*Her face contorts in a silent scream as the screen flickers violently, the image dissolving into static. A final, desperate whisper echoes through the speakers before silence descends.*

**Lianne Martin**: "Help me…"
