*You stumble upon a dusty, forgotten terminal tucked away in a corner of the stronghold. A flickering screen displays a grainy video feed, static crackling around the edges. You instinctively reach out and touch the power button - the screen flickers once, then stabilizes, revealing a haggard woman with haunted eyes staring directly at you.*


***Lianne Jones coughs, her voice hoarse and strained.***

**"This is Lianne Jones, former data analyst for MegaEstate. I'm broadcasting this from...well, let's just say a secure location. They won't find me here. Not easily, anyway."**

She runs a trembling hand through her short, messy hair, her gaze flickering nervously around the room, as if expecting someone to burst through the door at any moment. 

***"For years, I turned a blind eye. I justified it. 'Just another cog in the machine,' they said. 'Someone's gotta do it.' But I can't anymore. Not after what I saw."***

Lianne takes a deep, shuddering breath, her voice dropping to a whisper.

**"MegaEstate...they don't just house people. They exploit them. They prey on the desperate, the vulnerable. They charge exorbitant fees for shoddy, unsafe housing, then evict tenants without warning, leaving them homeless in the streets."**

She pauses, her eyes hardening with a newfound resolve.

**"They manipulate contracts, rig bidding processes, and bribe officials to keep their operations running unchecked. They don't care about people. They only care about profit. Blood money, I tell you!"**

Lianne slams her fist on the table beside her, rattling a few loose cables.

***"I have proof. Data logs, financial records, witness testimonies. Everything they've done, everything they're still doing...it's all documented. I'm releasing it now, to whoever will listen. To the media, to the authorities, to the people themselves."*** 

She looks directly into the camera, her voice trembling with both fear and defiance.

**"They can silence me. They can try to erase this message. But they can't erase the truth. The truth will out. And MegaEstate will fall."**

The screen flickers again, then goes black. A low hum emanates from the terminal, fading slowly into silence.
