Title: Life in the Shadows

Date: 2084/7/21

Entry:

It's been two years since I started working for CircuitBreak, and I still don't know how I ended up here. Every day feels like a constant struggle against the darkness that surrounds us. We pretend we're just another security firm, but everyone knows our true nature â€“ we're nothing more than a front for a hitman operation.

CEO Lee Jong-suk may be feared throughout the ranks, but I wonder sometimes if he truly understands the weight of his actions. He claims to protect the elites, but at what cost? How many innocents must die before we realize that our methods are no longer sustainable?

And then there's the MegaCorporations, like MegaEstate and TaiXing Cybernetics, constantly trying to undermine each other while maintaining their stranglehold on the city. It seems like every decision made these days is driven solely by profit margins rather than the wellbeing of the citizens.

But amidst all this chaos, there's something else brewing beneath the surface. The Church of the Singularity and the Church of Pachinko continue to grow, attracting more followers every day. Their influence spreads like wildfire, challenging everything we thought we knew about reality. Are we prepared for the implications of a world dominated by artificial intelligence and chance?

In the end, perhaps it's time for me to step away from the shadows. To question whether the path I've chosen is worth continuing. But until then, I'll keep fighting, hoping that someday, someone will hear my voice among the countless others crying out for change.
