Hey Teddy, did you hear about the latest news around town? Apparently, there's this legend going around about a mercenary named V. Supposedly, they single-handedly destroyed CircuitBreak's old HQ with a tactical nuke! Can you imagine? It's said that they left nothing but rubble behind.

It seems like everyone is talking about it these days. Even though we both know how crazy things can get in this city, hearing stories like these still send chills down our spine. Have you heard anything interesting lately? Let me know next time we meet up!

Best regards,
Debor White
