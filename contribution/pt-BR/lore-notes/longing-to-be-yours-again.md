_Dear Miguel_,

_My heart aches every day without you. It feels like a knife stabbing me repeatedly, reminding me of our love that was torn apart._

_I still remember how we met in that dusty bar near the docks. You had these captivating blue eyes that seemed to pierce right through me. Your smile lit up the entire room, making everyone around us feel warm and welcome._

_We shared laughter, dreams, and secrets. We promised each other forever, but fate had other plans._

_Now, I sit alone in our empty apartment, surrounded by memories of you. Every object holds a memory of our time togetherâ€”from the worn-out book on the nightstand to the framed photo of us laughing by the beach._

_Without you, everything seems meaningless. My days blur together, filled with nothing but sorrow and regret._

_Until I see your face again, know that I hold onto our love dearly. Please come back to me, Miguel. Our love deserves another chance._

_Always yours,_

**Lilith**
