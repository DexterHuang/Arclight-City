>Today was another day at the office, another job done right. But something feels off lately, our jobs seem more brutal than usual. Maybe it's just me getting paranoid after hearing all these rumors about Lee Jong-suk being involved in some shady businesses. Or maybe it's the constant pressure from upper management to deliver results no matter what. Whatever it is, I can feel myself breaking down slowly.

>I wish someone would listen to us, we're just doing our jobs after all. It doesn't help that everyone around seems so cold and distant these days. Even Wei Chang, our beloved CEO, seems preoccupied with something else entirely. Sometimes I wonder if anyone really cares about us anymore.
