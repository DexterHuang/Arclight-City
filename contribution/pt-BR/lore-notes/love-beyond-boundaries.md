My Dear Diego,

By now, you must know that our love is forbidden. Our families would never accept us, especially after everything that happened. But I cannot help myself anymore. Every moment without you feels like an eternity.

I remember how we met during that chance encounter outside the marketplace. Your smile lit up my world, and your touch sent shivers down my spine. We shared stolen glances across crowded rooms filled with people who didn't understand the depth of our feelings.

But fate had other plans for us. As much as it hurts me to say this, we must go our separate ways before someone discovers our secret. Please promise me that you won't forget about me or what we shared.

Until we meet again (if ever), take care of yourself, my dear Diego. May the stars guide you towards happiness and peace.

Yours forever,

Melanie Edwards
