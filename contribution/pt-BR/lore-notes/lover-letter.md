You stumble upon an old, dusty bookshelf in the corner of the room. Amongst the decaying tomes, you spot a thin, leather-bound journal. Curiosity piqued, you pull it from the shelf and flip open the cover.

*To my dearest Amara,*

*I hope this letter finds you well. I miss you more than words can express. The nights are long and cold without your warmth beside me. Your laughter echoes in my thoughts, a melody that haunts my dreams.*

*I remember the day we met at the Red Bar, how our eyes locked across the crowd like two magnets drawn to each other. It was as if time stood still for a moment, just for us. I knew then and there, Amara, that I had found my soulmate.*

*The city outside our window pulsates with life, but without you by my side, it feels empty. The neon lights of Arclight City cannot compare to the glow of your smile. And even though the shadows cast by CircuitBreak's goons loom large over us, I swear to protect you from harm.*

*We are but mere whispers in this vast metropolis, two hearts beating as one. But sometimes, I fear that our love is not enough to overcome the darkness that threatens to consume us.*

*Please be safe, my dear Amara. Remember, no matter where life takes us, we will always find our way back to each other. Until then, know that you hold a piece of my soul in your hands.*

*With all my love,*

*Ethan*
