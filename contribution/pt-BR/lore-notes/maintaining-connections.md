*You notice a small recording device lying on the ground near a desk.*

[Chloe]: Hey Alex, how's it going man? You know we haven't hung out in ages.

---
*Alex sighs heavily before responding.*

Alex: Yeah, I know. It's just been crazy lately with all these jobs coming in left and right. We barely have time to breathe let alone catch up over drinks.

---
*There's a long pause before Chloe speaks again.*

Chloe: Listen, I understand that things are hectic but don't forget about us okay? Your crew is important to you and we want to see more of you too.

---
*Alex clears his throat awkwardly.*

Alex: Of course, I appreciate that Chloe. I promise I'll try to take some time off after our next job. Maybe we could grab dinner or something?

---
*Chloe laughs softly.*

Chloe: Sounds good to me. Just remember, no matter how busy things get, we're always here for each other. Now stop making excuses and call us next time you need backup.

---
*The recording ends abruptly, leaving Alex contemplative.*
