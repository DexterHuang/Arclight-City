As you were looting the stronghold, you noticed a cyberdeck on a table, with a message open.

> Message from: Malachi Sanchez

> *Dear Mercenary,*
> 
> I know what you're thinking: another note in this godforsaken gang hideout. But listen closely, because this is different. My name is Malachi Sanchez, and I'm writing to you from the depths of Arclight City's seedy underbelly.
> 
> You see, I used to be just like you—a mercenary for hire, a cog in the machine that keeps this city running. But then I realized something: we're all pawns in someone else's game. The mega corporations, the gangs, even the police—they don't care about us, only about their own power and wealth.
> 
> So now, I'm making a stand. I've gathered information on some of the most corrupt organizations in this city: CircuitBreak, MegaEstate, TaiXing Cybernetic, and Trauma Team. I have evidence that will bring them all down if it gets into the right hands.
> 
> But here's my proposal: instead of taking what I've found to the authorities (who are just as corrupt as the companies I mentioned), why don't we use this information for ourselves? We can blackmail these corporations, force them to pay us or risk exposure. Imagine the power we'd have!
> 
> Of course, there's a catch. I need your help to pull this off. You know how to move through the city unnoticed, how to gather intel and make deals in the shadows. Together, we can take down these giants and reclaim some of the power they've stolen from us.
> 
> If you're interested, meet me at the Red Bar tonight at midnight. Come alone, and don't bring any weapons—I need to know I can trust you. We'll discuss details then.
> 
> Remember, it's not just about money anymore. It's about taking control of our lives in this dystopian nightmare we call home.
> 
> *Either join me or regret your decision,*
