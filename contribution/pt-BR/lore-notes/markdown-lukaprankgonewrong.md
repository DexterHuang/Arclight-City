As you rummaged through the abandoned stronghold, your fingers brushed against a crumpled-up note. You unfolded it and read:

> Choom,
> 
> We were planning the craziest prank for our friend Luka Stewart today. It was supposed to be epic! But things went south real quick, and now we're all laughing about it. Here's what happened:
> 
> Fifine Nelson had this wild idea of using the Black Market's new "Smart Cockroach" mods to take over Luka's apartment while he was out on a date with some fancy elitist girl from MegaEstate. The plan was to have these little buggers crawl all over her and make her freak out, then film the whole thing for future blackmail material. Genius, right?
> 
> Well, we got the mods from our contact at the Black Market - a guy called "The Dealer" who always has the craziest stuff. We spent hours programming these roaches to do our bidding and even installed some low-grade explosives on them just for fun. The whole Choomba was in stitches, planning the perfect setup.
> 
> But then something unexpected happened: Griffin Torres got cold feet at the last minute. He said it was "too risky" and that we'd get caught by the ACPD or something. So, he ditched us at the last second, leaving only half our crew to pull off this epic prank.
> 
> Well, long story short, the prank backfired spectacularly. The explosives went off early, and instead of crawling all over that elitist chick, they ended up blowing up Luka's apartment building! Can you believe it? We caused a whole block to go up in flames just for a laugh.
> 
> Luka was livid when he found out, but we figure he'll eventually see the humor in it. After all, what's life without a little chaos now and then? And hey, at least we didn't end up as Cyberpsychos from using too much cyberwear, right?
> 
> Anyway, I'm still laughing about this whole debacle. Maybe next time we'll stick to simpler pranks that don't involve explosives or arson.
> 
> Stay safe out there, Choom. And remember: when in doubt, always choose the craziest option!
