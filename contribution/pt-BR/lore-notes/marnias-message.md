As you were looting the stronghold, you noticed a cyberdeck on a table, with a message open.

> Message from: Braxton Parker
> 
> Hey there, this is Marnia Lopez speaking. I am not sure what to do! I am so scared. As you know, I was hired by The Whisperer to join a crew for a gig at the MegaEstate building. We were supposed to steal some sensitive data from their server. But things went south real quick.
> 
> When we got into the building, we found out that CircuitBreak had been tipped off about our heist. They were waiting for us on every floor! We barely made it out alive, but not without taking a few bullets. Our crew leader, Braxton Parker, took a hit to the chest and collapsed right in front of me. I don't know if he made it or not.
> 
> I managed to slip away from the chaos and hide in this abandoned room. My leg is bleeding pretty bad, but I think I can still make it out of here if I can find a way to disable these security bots patrolling outside.
> 
> If you're reading this, Braxton, please know that I'm sorry for not being able to protect you. And if you're not Braxton, well... just forget you ever found this message.
> 
> Marnia Lopez

As you close the message, you feel a sudden urge to help Marnia. After all, she seems like a nice person who got caught up in something way over her head. You decide to use your cyberdeck to hack into the security system and disable those bots for her.
