*As you were rummaging through a pile of documents on a desk, you come across an unopened envelope addressed to "Dear Daddy"*.

---
> Dear Daddy,
> 
> I hope this letter finds you well. Mom says you're busy doing important work for the Truama Team, but I miss you so much! I heard from my friends that being a mercenary is cool and all, but I just want you to come home and play with me.
> 
> Please, can you bring me something back? Maybe one of those fancy cyberwear suits or an AI toy like the ones the rich kids have in our neighborhood. It would be so awesome to have my own personal assistant, just like the ones in those holo-movies we used to watch together.
> 
> I've been extra good at school and even learned how to use a cyberdeck from one of Kaye Morris's older brothers. He said I have a natural talent for hacking, just like you do. Maybe you could teach me more when you come home?
> 
> I had a dream last night that we were both in the Quantum District, exploring the mind-bending experiments and playing pachinko at the Church of Pachinko. It was so much fun! Can we go there together when you're back from your mission?
> 
> Please write me soon, Daddy. I love you more than all the netcoins in the Black Market.
> 
> Your little Choomba,
> 
> Marty

*You close the letter and slip it back into the envelope, feeling a pang of sympathy for the young kid longing for his father.*
