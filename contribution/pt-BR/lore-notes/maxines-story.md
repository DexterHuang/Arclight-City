## Audio Log: Maxine's Story

*Maxine's gruff voice fills the room.*

**Maxine**: "So you want to know how I got into this business, huh? Well, let me tell ya. Back when I was just a young gun, I was one of the best mercs in Arclight City. But after a few too many run-ins with the law and some shady corporations, I decided it was time for a change."

*A soft sound of laughter can be heard.*

**Maxine**: "I opened up this little shop here in the Red Bar district, specializing in weapons and cybernetics. It's been a hell of a ride, but let me tell you something: I've seen it all."

*A pause, then Maxine clears her throat.*

**Maxine**: "Now, if you're looking for someone to help you upgrade your gear or take down a rival gang, you know where to find me. And remember, always keep your friends close and your enemies closer â€“ especially in this city."

*The sound of a door closing is heard, followed by the ambient noise of the Red Bar district.*
