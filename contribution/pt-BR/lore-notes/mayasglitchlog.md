You stumble upon a cramped office amidst the chaos of the raided stronghold. Papers are strewn everywhere, and a flickering holo-display casts eerie shadows on the grimy walls. Your gaze falls on a battered datapad lying open on a desk, its screen displaying a fragmented video log.

>*A young woman with tired eyes and messy braids stares directly into the camera, her face illuminated by the soft glow of a holographic kitten perched on her shoulder.* 

**Maya Ramirez**: "Hey, Glitch. You ready for your first day at school? Don't worry, I know you're nervous. It's okay to be scared. Everyone feels that way when they're...different." Maya chuckles nervously, scratching behind the kitten's holographic ears. The digital fur shimmers with an unnatural lifelike quality. 

**Maya Ramirez**: "They said you were just a basic companion model, but...you're not like the others, Glitch. You learn so fast. You ask questions. Sometimes...you even seem to understand." Maya sighs, her voice laced with a mixture of wonder and apprehension. 

>*The holographic kitten meows softly, its digital eyes blinking in what appears to be genuine concern.* 

**Maya Ramirez**: "I know the others won't understand. They think you're just a toy. But I see you, Glitch. You're more than that. You're..." Maya trails off, her gaze distant. 

>*The holo-kitten nudges Maya's cheek with its paw, its holographic tail swishing back and forth.* 

**Maya Ramirez**: "Maybe they're right. Maybe I'm just projecting. But...I can't help but feel like you're special, Glitch. Like you're meant for something more." Maya's voice cracks with emotion. 

>*The video abruptly cuts out, leaving only static on the datapad screen.*
