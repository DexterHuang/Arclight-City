**Subject: Classified Report on Mega Corporation Activities - Arclight City**

*Date: 2081/3/5*

*Classification:* Top Secret

This report is to be submitted to the Arclight City Council for their review and action. The purpose of this document is to provide a detailed analysis of the activities and influence of Mega Corporations in our city, focusing on CircuitBreak, MegaEstate, TaiXing Cybernetic, and Trauma Team.

**CircuitBreak:** This security company has been operating in Arclight City for over two decades. They provide top-notch security services to the elites but have also been involved in several hitman operations. Our investigations reveal that CircuitBreak is heavily linked with the ACPD, which helps them execute their criminal activities undisturbed.

**MegaEstate:** This housing agency has a stronghold on the city's real estate market. They have been accused of price-fixing and ripping off customers for years. Our sources indicate that MegaEstate is involved in bribery, corrupt practices, and even land grabbing to expand their business empire.

**TaiXing Cybernetic:** This Taiwanese-based company has become a major player in the city's cybernetic industry. They produce state-of-the-art cyberwares and implants, which are highly sought after by citizens. While they have not been involved in any criminal activities as of now, their close ties with some Mega Corporation executives raise concerns about potential conflicts of interest.

**Trauma Team:** This medical company provides elite medical services to the wealthy residents of Arclight City. However, our investigations have uncovered that Trauma Team is involved in organ harvesting from poor and homeless individuals. The organs are then sold to their high-paying clients. This company's actions not only violate basic human rights but also contribute to the widening gap between the rich and the poor in our city.

In conclusion, these Mega Corporations pose a significant threat to Arclight City's stability and well-being. We recommend that the Council take immediate action to regulate their activities and bring them under control. Failure to do so may result in further corruption, crime, and social unrest within our city.
