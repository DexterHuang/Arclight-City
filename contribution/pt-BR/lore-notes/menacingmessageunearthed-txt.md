To Whomever Finds This Note:

Listen carefully, we know exactly who you are and what you stand for. We have been watching you closely, waiting for the right moment to strike. Now that you have stumbled upon our little hideaway, we must warn youâ€”leave immediately or face dire consequences.

Do not attempt to contact anyone about this matter. Your silence will ensure your safety (for now). Pay attention to the news and await further instructions.

Remember, no one can protect you from us. We are everywhere and nowhere at the same time. Sleep tight, dear one.

Signed,

The Watchful Ones
