Working for CircuitBreak Security Inc. isn't easy, especially after the recent cutbacks due to the economic crisis caused by the collapse of the stock market last year. Our paychecks keep getting smaller while our workload keeps increasing. It feels like we're being squeezed dry by the corporation.

But that's not even the worst part. We've been ordered to crack down harder on protestors against the MegaCorporations, even if it means using excessive force. And let me tell you, seeing innocent civilians get hurt just breaks my heart.

I don't know how long I can continue doing this job without losing myself completely. Maybe it's time to start looking for another job...if there even is one out there anymore.

Signed,

Nady Hernandez
