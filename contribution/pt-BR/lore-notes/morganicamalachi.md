As you were looting the stronghold, you noticed a cyberdeck on a table, with a message open.

> Message from: Malachi Green
> 
> *Dear Morganica,*
> 
> I hope this message finds you well. I have been thinking about our last conversation and I believe it's time for us to part ways. As much as I value our friendship, I can no longer trust that we share the same goals and intentions.
> 
> The more I learn about your alliances and affiliations, the less I feel comfortable continuing down this path together. I understand that we are both trying to survive in this harsh city, but our methods seem to be diverging.
> 
> *Please,* do not take this as a personal attack. You know me better than anyone; I would never betray you or put you in danger. But for my own safety and peace of mind, I must distance myself from your activities.
> 
> If there is anything I can do to help you in the future, please do not hesitate to reach out. But for now, let's consider ourselves on separate paths.
> 
> *Take care,*
> 
> *Malachi*

> I was surprised to receive your message, but I understand your concerns and respect your decision to distance yourself. While our methods may differ, I believe we both share a desire for survival and success in this city.
> 
> I assure you that your well-being is not at risk due to our association. However, if you feel more comfortable on your own path, then so be it. We cannot control the direction life takes us.
> 
> *Please,* remember that despite our separation, you will always have a friend in me. If you ever need assistance or simply someone to talk to, I am only a message away.
