> Dear Lilith,
>
> My name is Suki Brown, and I just want to tell you how amazing you are. Your beauty, both inside and out, never ceases to astound me. Every day I see you walking around the city with your graceful stride, head held high, dressed impeccably in your signature style – it’s breathtaking.
>
> But more than that, it’s your spirit that captivates me. You carry yourself with confidence and strength, yet remain approachable and kind. You embrace your unique identity without apology, inspiring others to do the same.
>
> I know we haven't met properly yet, but please know that every time our paths cross, my heart skips a beat. If given the chance, I would love nothing more than to share a cup of coffee (or tea) with you and learn more about the incredible woman behind the legend.
>
> Until then, take care of yourself and keep shining brightly. You truly are my hero.
>
> Yours sincerely,
>
> Suki Brown
