As you rummage through the debris of the gang stronghold, your eyes catch sight of a crumpled piece of paper tucked away behind a stack of old magazines. You pick it up and unfold it cautiously. The note reads:

> *Dear Family,*
> 
> I'm writing this from my hiding spot in the Arclight City gang stronghold, where I've been forced to take refuge after being betrayed by my former comrades. I never wanted any of this – just a simple life with you all, but fate had other plans.
> 
> I'm sorry for leaving you all behind, but I can't risk bringing danger to your doorstep. Please know that I love each and every one of you more than words can express. Take care of Grandma for me – she means the world to me.
> 
> If you find this note, it means I won't be coming home. Know that I die with love in my heart for all of you. Protect one another and never forget how much joy you brought into my life.
> 
> Your loving father/sister/brother,
> 
> *Loretta Scott*
