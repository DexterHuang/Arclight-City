**Mercenary**: RipperDoc, I'm heading into a raid on that gang stronghold, and I need your most potent Neuroblocker mods.

**RipperDoc**: Listen up, chummer. These Neuroblockers ain't your average joyride. They're too heavy-duty for someone like you.

**Mercenary**: RipperDoc, hear me clear. I'm diving headfirst into that gang's turf, and I want only the best Neuroblockers you've got.

**RipperDoc**: You're on a suicide run, omae. My top-shelf mods would fry you to a crisp. You better hit up some other chrome surgeon for weaker drek.

**Mercenary**: RipperDoc, cut the drek. I'm storming that stronghold, and I'm only interested in your finest Neuroblockers.

**RipperDoc**: You're clueless, choomba. My strongest mods would scramble a rogue AI, let alone a lightweight like you. You need a RipperDoc peddling weak sauce, 'cause my gear is too heavy-duty.

**Mercenary**: RipperDoc, I've had enough of your shadow games. I'm taking down that gang, and I need your top-tier Neuroblockers.

**RipperDoc**: You're a code short of an AI, choombatta. My top-level mods would short your system, not just your meatsuit. You better find a ripper who deals in baby mods.

**Mercenary**: Frag it, RipperDoc! I'm not messing around. I'm raiding that gang stronghold, and I'll find another ripper for those Neuroblockers.

**RipperDoc**: That's the dance, slick. Slide on over to a different chop shop. My mods are too slick for the likes of you. You need some weak tea, not my heavy metal.
