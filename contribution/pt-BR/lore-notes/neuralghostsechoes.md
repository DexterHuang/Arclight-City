You stumble upon a dusty terminal tucked away in a corner, its screen flickering faintly. A half-empty energy drink can sits precariously beside it, hinting at a hurried departure. Curiosity piqued, you boot up the terminal and find an active forum thread titled "Neural Ghosts - We're Not Alone."

> **Subject: Another Glitch...**

> Been two weeks since the breach. Still getting phantom messages, voices whispering in my head even when I'm offline. It's like a ghost in the machine, haunting me with fragments of code and stolen thoughts. 

> Anyone else experiencing this?  I tried everything - full system wipe, new implants, even a visit to Oriana (expensive, but worth it). Nothing seems to fully purge the echoes. Feels like they're embedded deep within my neural pathways now.

> **Re: Another Glitch...**

> Kairos77, you're not alone. I get those phantom whispers too. It's like someone's trying to communicate through the static, but the message is always fragmented, distorted.  Makes trusting anyone, even my own thoughts, a nightmare. 

> I went full isolation for a week, unplugged everything except essentials. Helped a little, but the whispers still find their way in.  Maybe we need to find a way to fight back, rewrite those corrupted pathways somehow.

> I hear ya, Echo_Fade. Trust is gone. It's like the breach ripped a hole in our minds, exposed us to something we weren't meant to see.  Now every connection feels tainted, every piece of tech a potential conduit for intrusion. 

> Maybe Zero Byte knows something? Heard whispers about them cracking the code of the attack, maybe they have a solution. But finding that elusive hacker is like chasing smoke in the wind...
