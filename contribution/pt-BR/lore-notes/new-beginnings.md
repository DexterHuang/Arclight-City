*Chloe sighs softly as she pours another drink for herself.*

Hey, stranger. Long time no see. How've you been holding up? It's been rough around these parts lately, hasn't it?

I know we don't talk much, but sometimes silence speaks volumes. And right now, I just need someone to listen. You seem like you could use a friendly ear yourself. So why don't you join me for a drink? We can share our stories, commiserate about the shitshow that is Arclight City, and maybe even forget our troubles for a while.

What do you say? One round on the house, compliments of yours truly. Just remember, what happens here stays between us chooms. Cheers!
