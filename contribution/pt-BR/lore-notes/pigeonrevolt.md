You stumble across a crumpled-up note on the grimy floor of the abandoned warehouse. Picking it up, you smooth out the creases and read:

"Hey Choom," starts the note, "Got an idea for the greatest prank ever! We're gonna pull this off tomorrow night at Red Bar. Our boy Trevor won't see it coming."

The writer continues, "We'll get some CircuitBreak disposable rigs and strap 'em to a bunch of pigeons. Then we'll release them just as he's about to take a sip from his favorite mug. Can you imagine the look on his face when those birds start shooting at him?"

Laughing to themselves, the writer scribbles, "I know it's risky, but it's gonna be so worth it. Just think of the netcoin we can make by selling the footage to CyberPunkTV. What do you say, Choomba? In or out?"

As you read further, a sudden change in tone becomes apparent. "Well, we went through with it last night," the note reads, "and things didn't quite go as planned."

"Turns out those pigeons were immune to the rigs and ended up turning on us. We barely escaped with our lives, and now ACPD is looking for us. Oh, and Trevor? He's still laughing his ass off at our expense. Can you believe it?"

The note concludes, "Guess we should've stuck to simpler pranks like gluing coins to the ground or putting laxatives in the vending machines. Anyway, gotta go hide this note before they find it and pin this on me. Stay low, Choom."

As you fold up the note and slip it into your pocket, you can't help but chuckle at the audacity of the prank gone wrong. The Arclight City streets never cease to surprise you.
