You stumbled upon a crumpled-up note amidst the chaos of the gang stronghold. Dusting off the debris, you read:

> "Hey Choom, this is gonna be the craziest prank ever! Remember our pal Sherri Gonzalez? The one with the fancy cybernetic eyes?

We're gonna pull a real doozy on her. Here's the plan:

1. Aprilette Rodriguez will hack into the Dreamscape Oasis District's VR system and create a custom scenario for Sherri.
2. I'll sneak into the district and plant a fake billboard ad right in front of her, saying she won a free cybernetic upgrade worth 500 Eddies! Who could resist that?
3. As soon as she accepts the "prize," Aprilette will trigger the VR scenario, and we'll all watch the hilarious confusion unfold through a hacked security camera feed.
4. To make it even more epic, I'll be disguised as a CircuitBreak hitman guarding the "upgrade" area. Once she gets close, I'll reveal my true identity and bust out laughing! Best prank ever, right?

Well, things didn't exactly go according to plan. You see, when Sherri got close enough, I revealed myself - but instead of laughing, she freaked out thinking I was a real hitman sent by MegaEstate! She dove headfirst into the nearest trash can and started screaming for help like a cyberpsycho.

It took us hours to convince her it was just a prank, and even then, she threatened to report us all to the Arclight City Police Department (ACPD). Oopsie! Oh well, at least we got a good laugh out of it, right?

Your Choom,
Wandis King"
