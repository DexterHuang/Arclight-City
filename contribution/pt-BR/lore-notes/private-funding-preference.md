Dear Wei and Robert,

Thank you both for reaching out regarding our potential partnership. As we discussed earlier, CircuitBreak Security is interested in exploring new opportunities beyond traditional security measures. We understand that TaiXing Cybernetics has been developing cutting-edge technology that could prove beneficial in this regard.

In terms of investment, while we appreciate the interest shown by Mr. Smith and MegEstate, we would prefer to keep initial funding private until further discussions about specific projects have taken place. Rest assured, once we see concrete results from our collaboration, we will certainly consider involving external parties.

Let's schedule another meeting soon to discuss details further.

Best regards,
Jong-suk Lee
CEO | CircuitBreak Security
