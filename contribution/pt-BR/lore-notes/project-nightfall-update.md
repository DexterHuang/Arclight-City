Hey Team,

As we discussed in the last meeting, I have some updates on Project Nightfall. The R&D team has been working tirelessly to perfect the prototype of our new cybernetic assassin, codenamed "Nightfall".

The good news is that they've made significant progress. The AI core is now capable of adapting to various environments and learning from past experiences, making it highly efficient in eliminating targets. However, there's a catch: the cost of production has increased due to the integration of TaiXing Cybernetic components. We're looking at an additional 50,000 Eddies per unit.

I understand that this may cause some concerns regarding profit margins, but I believe the advanced capabilities of Nightfall will justify the investment in the long run. Besides, with MegaEstate's latest contract for high-profile target eliminations, we could have enough orders to cover the increased production costs.

Please review the attached prototype spec sheet and provide your feedback by tomorrow morning. I'll compile your thoughts and present them during our meeting with the board of directors.

Let me know if you have any questions or concerns.

Best,
Lyssa Parker
Project Manager, CircuitBreak
