You stumble upon a hidden compartment behind a loose panel in the wall. Inside, nestled amongst discarded weapons and empty energy drink cans, is a battered datapad. Its screen flickers weakly, but you manage to power it up. A grainy video log begins to play.

*The camera shakes slightly, revealing a gaunt face with dark circles under bloodshot eyes. A young woman, her hair pulled back in a tight ponytail, stares directly into the lens.*

**Maya Ramirez**:  "This is... this is crazy. I can't believe I'm doing this. But I have to get this out there. Someone has to know what BioSyn is planning." 

*She takes a shaky breath, her voice cracking with emotion.*

**Maya Ramirez**: "I work in the R&D department at BioSyn's Arclight City facility. We're not just developing gene therapies like they claim. They've been working on something... something far more sinister." 

*A flicker of fear crosses her face.*

**Maya Ramirez**: "They've engineered a virus, a bioweapon designed to be highly contagious and... selective. It targets specific genetic markers, meaning it would wipe out entire populations based on their ancestry. They call it 'Project Chimera'." 

*She pauses, her eyes welling up with tears.*

**Maya Ramirez**: "They're planning to release it in a densely populated sector of the city, claim it's a natural outbreak, and then offer their supposed cure â€“ a heavily modified gene therapy that will make them billions. They don't care about lives, they only care about profit. I saw the data, the simulations... it's genocide."

*Her voice breaks, choked with sobs.*

**Maya Ramirez**: "I can't stand by and let this happen. I had to get this out. If anyone finds this, please... please expose them. Stop Project Chimera before it's too late."

The video ends abruptly, the screen fading to black. You stare at the datapad, a cold dread settling in your gut. Maya Ramirez's desperate plea echoes in your mind. What will you do with this information?
