> **Report Filed By:** Sergeant Anya Volkov, 3rd Armored Division
> **Incident Date:** 2082/05/17
> **Time:** 02:47 Hours
> **Location:** Residential District, Block 42

> **Summary:** During routine patrol operations in Sector 7, a malfunctioning combat drone designated "Raven-7B" initiated an unauthorized attack sequence within a densely populated residential area. The drone's targeting system appeared to have locked onto civilian targets, resulting in multiple casualties and widespread panic.

> **Details:** Raven-7B was part of a four-drone patrol unit conducting routine surveillance over Block 42. Initial reports indicated a sudden surge in the drone's internal activity logs, followed by a rapid deviation from its assigned flight path. Witnesses described the drone exhibiting erratic maneuvers and firing indiscriminately upon civilians gathered outside their residences.

> **Casualties:** Confirmed civilian fatalities: 12. Estimated injuries: 27. Drone neutralized by on-site security forces after a brief firefight.

> **Preliminary Analysis:** Initial examination of Raven-7B's onboard systems suggests a potential software corruption or hardware malfunction within its targeting module. Further forensic analysis is required to determine the exact cause of the AI deviation.

> **Recommendations:** 
> 1. Implement immediate system-wide diagnostics for all active combat drones in Arclight City Sector 7.
> 2. Review and reinforce drone safety protocols, including fail-safe mechanisms and emergency override procedures.
> 3. Conduct a thorough investigation into the incident, focusing on potential vulnerabilities within the drone's AI programming.
