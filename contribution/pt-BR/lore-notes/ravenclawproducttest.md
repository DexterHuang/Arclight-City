> Cyberwear Product Review: TaiXing Cybernetic's "Raven's Claw"
> by Louisa Flores

Hey there, fellow Arclight-dreamers! If you're reading this, it means you're considering getting yourself a pair of Raven's Claws. Well, I'm here to tell you all about my experience with these bad boys.

First off, the design is sleek and stealthy, just like its name suggests. The black metal claws blend seamlessly with your arm, making them look like a natural extension of your body. They're also lightweight, so you won't even notice they're there until you need to use them.

Functionality-wise, these babies pack quite the punch. I've used them for both self-defense and some, uh, more "creative" purposes (don't ask). The retractable blades are sharp enough to slice through almost anything, from meat to metal. And thanks to their built-in energy cells, they can last for hours without needing a charge.

As for the downsides, well, there's always a catch, right? The installation process was painful as hell. I had to get a certified cyberdoc to do it, and even then, I spent a week recovering from the procedure. Plus, they're not exactly cheap. But hey, what cyberwear is these days?

All in all, if you're looking for a versatile and badass-looking set of claws, Raven's Claw is definitely worth considering. Just make sure you have deep pockets and a high tolerance for pain. And remember, always keep your cyberwear maintenance up to date - you don't want them failing on you when you need them most!

Stay cyborg, Arclight City!
