> *A chilling wave of cyberpsycho violence has gripped the heart of Sector 7 tonight, leaving behind a trail of devastation and unanswered questions. Witnesses describe a scene of utter pandemonium as a heavily augmented individual, later identified by authorities as "Razorback," rampaged through crowded streets, indiscriminately targeting civilians and security personnel.*

> *The rampage began shortly after midnight at the popular Neon Oasis nightclub. Razorback, reportedly wielding a pair of modified katana blades and augmented with grotesque cybernetic enhancements, tore through the club's defenses, leaving a bloody carnage in his wake. Eyewitnesses claim he moved with inhuman speed and ferocity, his cybernetic implants emitting an eerie blue glow as he hacked and slashed through terrified patrons.*

> *The ACPD, despite deploying multiple units, was unable to contain Razorback's rampage. Their attempts to subdue him were met with brutal resistance, leaving several officers injured. The situation escalated rapidly, with Razorback eventually targeting nearby residential buildings, causing widespread panic and destruction.*

> *Finally, after hours of relentless carnage, CircuitBreak security forces arrived on the scene, deploying specialized counter-cyberpsycho units equipped with advanced weaponry designed to neutralize rogue cybernetic implants. A tense standoff ensued, culminating in a fierce firefight that ultimately brought Razorback down.*

> *The cost of this nightmarish attack is still being tallied. Dozens are confirmed dead, and countless others injured. The incident has raised serious concerns about the city's ability to effectively manage the growing threat of cyberpsycho outbreaks. Many citizens are now calling for stricter regulations on cybernetic enhancements and increased funding for mental health services to address the root causes of this escalating crisis.*
