You rummage through a dusty locker, crammed with discarded weapons and greasy takeout containers.  A crumpled data pad slips out, its screen flickering faintly. You brush off the grime and manage to power it on. It opens to a hastily typed message, the font distorted and glitching.

> **Subject: Urgent! Smart-Sphincter Malfunction - Model SS-3000 (Serial # 47B2F9)**

> To Whom It May Concern at TaiXing Cybernetic Customer Service (or whoever the hell is left after this mess),

> Let me preface this by saying I’m a damn *professional*.  I run ops for the Crimson Hawks, and my sphincter control used to be as tight as my trigger finger. Now? It's more like a goddamn symphony orchestra down there. 

> Installed your fancy SS-3000 Smart-Sphincter three weeks ago, thought it was slick.  Supposed to regulate bowel movements, eliminate embarrassing moments in the field. Yeah, well, turns out it’s more interested in composing its own damn opera. 

> First, it was a low rumble during a hostage negotiation. Thought it was my stomach. Then came a full-blown bassoon solo during a firefight.  My choom almost choked on his noodles laughing. Now? It's like a goddamn bagpipe convention in my pants whenever I get stressed. 

> Last night, during a raid on MegaEstate’s data center (don’t ask), I let loose a high-pitched piccolo solo that triggered the building's security alarms. We got caught, lost half our crew, and now I’m stuck with this goddamn musical instrument where my ass should be. 

> Look, I need a fix.  A permanent one. Either reprogram this thing to play Beethoven's Fifth (at least that's something I can respect), or yank it out and give me a refund. My reputation as a silent killer is hanging by a thread, and frankly, the only thing more embarrassing than a cyberpsycho is a farting mercenary.
