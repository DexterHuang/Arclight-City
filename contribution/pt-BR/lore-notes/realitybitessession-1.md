*You found a datapad lying near a discarded energy drink can. It’s cracked and dusty, but still powered on. A holographic projection flickers to life, revealing a dimly lit room with a dozen faces staring back at you. The faces are blurry, their features warped by the low resolution of the recording.*

**Moderator (voice distorted):**  Alright chooms, welcome to tonight’s session of “Reality Bites.” Remember, this is a safe space. No shame in admitting you need a hand getting back to…you know…the real world. 

*The camera pans across the faces, revealing a mix of despair and nervous laughter.*

**Latashia Edwards (young woman, cybernetic eye twitching):**  I…I think I accidentally married my avatar last week. Turns out he wasn’t actually a sentient AI, just a really convincing program. My bio-mom is not happy about the prenuptial agreement I signed in the Metaverse. 

*A ripple of sympathetic chuckles runs through the group.*

**Sonny Martin (older man, sweating profusely):**  Don’t even get me started on avatars. I spent a month building this perfect virtual body, ripped abs, flowing hair…the works! Then I logged in and realized I forgot to set my real-world reflection to match. Now I walk around looking like a troll with a bad toupee. It’s brutal, man, brutal. 

**Moderator:**  Sonny, that’s rough. Remember, the key is balance. Don’t let your AR experience consume you. 

*A voice crackles through the speakers, distorted and frantic.*

**Unknown (voice muffled):** They’re coming! The Glitch Horde is here! They want to steal my neural implants! I gotta hide! Gotta…

*The feed cuts abruptly, replaced by static.*

*The holographic projection flickers and fades, leaving you alone with the datapad and the unsettling echoes of their stories. You wonder what happened to that last voice, lost in a world they couldn't escape.*
