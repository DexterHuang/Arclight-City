You found an old datapad lying on the floor, half-hidden under a pile of discarded synth-leather jackets.  A faint glow emanates from its cracked screen. It appears to be a recording from an Augmented Reality Addiction Support Group session, titled "Reality Bites."

**Moderator (calm, soothing voice):** Welcome back, chooms, to another session of Reality Bites. Remember, this space is for sharing, not judgment. Let's start with Marcus. How are things looking in your augmented world today?

**Marcus (voice cracking, slightly manic):**  Things are…intense. I swear, the neon dragons are getting bolder. They keep trying to recruit me into their gang. They promised me unlimited ramen and a personalized fire-breathing cybernetic arm. It's hard to say no to that, you know?

**Moderator:** (chuckles softly) Sounds tempting, Marcus. But remember, those are just projections. The real world might not offer virtual ramen or fire arms.

**Marcus (voice rising):**  But the dragons are so real! I can feel their scales against my skin, smell the sulfur from their breath… 

**Female Voice (sarcastic):** Yeah, and I bet you taste delicious virtual ramen too, right?

**Marcus (defensive):** It's not a joke, Brenda! You wouldn't understand.

**Brenda (dryly):** Oh, honey, I get it. I once spent three days convinced I was dating a holographic Elvis impersonator. He sang me "Can't Help Falling in Love" while serenading me with pixelated roses.  Turns out, he wasn't even real. Just another glitch in the system.

**Moderator:** Brenda, that sounds…intense. But it's good to remember that these virtual experiences, however immersive, aren't actual relationships. 

**Male Voice (weepy):** I miss my wife. She left me because I spent all our time together in the AR world. Now she says I'm a "digital ghost," haunting her memories with pixelated promises.  She doesn't understand…it was real to me!


**Moderator:**  It's understandable to feel pain, David. But remember, there's a real world waiting for you outside those virtual walls. It might not be as flashy, but it's filled with genuine connections and experiences.

The recording abruptly cuts off, leaving the player with a lingering sense of melancholy and a reminder of the fragile line between reality and digital fantasy.
