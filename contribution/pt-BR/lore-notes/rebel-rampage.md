[Clementine]: Hey Suki, did you hear about the crazy stuff happening around town lately?
[Suki]: Yeah Clementine, I heard rumors about a legend named V going around. Supposedly they just wiped out an entire gang hideout singlehandedly.
[Clementine]: Wow, really? That sounds intense. Any idea why they targeted that particular gang?
[Suki]: Not exactly, but word on the street is that they had something to do with CircuitBreak. Maybe they were trying to send a message or something.
[Clementine]: Hmmm, could be interesting times ahead then. You know how these things tend to escalate quickly in this city.
[Suki]: For sure Clementine, we should keep our ears open and stay safe. You never know when trouble might come knocking at our doorstep.
