*In a dimly lit basement, hidden away from prying eyes, you stumble upon a crumpled piece of paper lying on a dusty table.*

---

*Your heart races as you pick up the note, feeling its weight in your trembling hand.*

It reads:

To all who seek freedom from the shackles of oppression, hear our call! We are the Children of Light, rising against the tyrannical darkness that engulfs us. Our numbers may be few now, but we grow stronger each day. Join us in our quest for justice and equality, for a brighter future awaits those who dare to dream. Together, we shall tear down the walls that divide us and build a new world free from fear and despair. Let our voices echo across the land, spreading hope and inspiration wherever we go. Forward, comrades! To victory and beyond!

Signed,
Laverna Carter
Leader of the Children of Light
