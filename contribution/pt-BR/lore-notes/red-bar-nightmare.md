*You found a diary on the floor of an abandoned building. The pages are filled with hastily scribbled words.*

Today was supposed to be just another day, but it turned out to be anything but ordinary. I had gone to the Red Bar for a drink after work when suddenly chaos erupted around me. People were screaming and running in all directions as if their lives depended on it. At first, I thought maybe there was some kind of terrorist attack or something like that.

But then I saw him - or rather what he had become. A man who used to be a regular at the bar now stood before me with eyes glowing red and an insane grin plastered across his face. He started shooting wildly, taking down anyone who dared cross his path. It was like something out of a nightmare come true.

I don't know how long I hid under the table trembling in fear, but eventually, it seemed safe enough to make my escape. As soon as I got home, I grabbed this diary and started writing down everything that had happened because if there was one thing for sure - no one would believe me otherwise.
