You find a crumpled datapad tucked under a loose floorboard. It’s cracked and dusty, but you manage to power it on. A single file blinks on the screen – "Regret." You open it hesitantly.

> *To whoever finds this... I don't even know if this will make sense anymore. They promised me peace, oblivion. Said the memories were poison, that forgetting would set me free. But now… now fragments are seeping back in. Like smoke through a crack in a wall.*

> *I remember flashes. Faces. A name – Elara. Laughter echoing in a crowded bar. The sting of tears, the warmth of a hand holding mine. And then… nothing. Blankness. They filled the void with their lies, their fabricated "new life." But the echoes won't be silenced.*

> *I thought I was choosing escape, but maybe I chose oblivion instead. Maybe forgetting wasn't freedom, but a cage of my own making. I traded my past for a hollow present, and now I fear I'm losing both.*

> *If you find this, please… remember me. Remember Elara. Tell her I'm sorry. Tell her I regret everything.*
