*You sift through scattered datapads and data chips amidst the ransacked office. One flimsy piece of paper catches your eye, tucked beneath a shattered monitor. It's handwritten, smudged with what looks like grease and tears.*

They said it would be clean. A fresh start. No more pain, no more memories of the bad times. Just… nothing. Empty. Like a new cyberdeck, ready to be programmed.  

But now… things are coming back. Fragments. Flickers. Faces I can't place, places I know I've been but can't remember why. A name keeps echoing in my head, whispering like a ghost: "Oriana."  Is that who they were trying to protect me from? 

I don't know anymore. My hands shake as I write this, the pen feeling foreign in my grip. They took everything from me, but what they didn't realize is… some things can't be erased. The guilt, the fear, it's all coming back, clawing its way out of the darkness. 

I made a deal with the devil, and now I'm paying the price.  

Please… if you find this, tell them… tell them I regret it. Tell them I want my memories back, even the bad ones. Even Oriana.
