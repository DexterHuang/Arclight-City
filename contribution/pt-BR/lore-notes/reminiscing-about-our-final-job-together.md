> It's been a while since we worked together, and I miss our adventures. I still remember how nervous I was during our first job, but you made me feel safe and confident. Your skills behind the keyboard are truly impressive, and I admire your ability to navigate the digital landscape with ease.

> As for our last mission, I know it didn't end well. But I want you to know that I hold no grudges against you. You did what you had to do to protect yourself, just as I would have done in your shoes. Besides, who knows? Maybe someday we'll cross paths again and continue our partnership. Until then, stay safe and keep hacking away!
