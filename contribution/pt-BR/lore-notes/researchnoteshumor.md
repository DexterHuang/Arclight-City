*You discover an old voice recorder on a desk, with multiple recordings. You select one titled "Research Notes"*

**Lind Lopez**: "*laughs*" Hey there, it's me again! Just some more fun findings I had while working on my latest project. You know, the usual stuff.

So, remember that time when I decided to test how many cyber-mites one person can have living in their ear? Yeah, well... let's just say I found out the hard way that 17 is *definitely* too many. The itchiness was unbearable!

And then there was this one time when I thought it would be a great idea to attach a mini rocket thruster to my cat, just for fun. Needless to say, he didn't appreciate the extra speed or the whole flying-through-the-wall thing. Poor guy still hasn't forgiven me...

Oh, and you know those new LED contact lenses that just hit the market? I decided to test them out by wearing them during a visit to Oriana. Talk about an interesting conversation starter! She seemed more intrigued by my eyes than my actual problem.

Anyway, that's all for now. Just remember, kids: don't try this at home! *laughs*
