To All Those Who Dare To Dream Of Change

We, the forgotten ones, rise against our oppressors. We shall no longer live in fear nor accept their cruelty. Our voices echo throughout the streets, demanding justice and equality for all.

CircuitBreak, MegaEstate, TaiXing Cybernetic, Truama Team—they may seem invincible now, but we see behind their masks of power. Their greed knows no bounds, exploiting us for profit while offering nothing but empty promises.

They cannot silence us anymore. It's time to take matters into our own hands and fight back. Together, we will tear down these walls of oppression and build something new—a society free from corruption and inequality.

Join Us Now Before It's Too Late!

Forward to Freedom!

Down with the Elites!

Up with the Workers!

Long Live the Revolution!
