Subject: A Risky Proposition

Dear Rhett,

I hope this message finds you well. I've been mulling over our recent conversation about the Arclight City Police Department (ACPD) and their corrupt ways. We both know that they are in the pocket of the Mega Corporations, and it's time we do something about it.

I have a risky proposition for us: what if we teamed up with The Church of Pachinko? They may seem like fanatics, but their influence in Arclight City cannot be ignored. If we can persuade them to join forces with us, we could potentially bring down the ACPD and expose their connections to the Mega Corporations.

I know this plan sounds crazy, but hear me out. The Church of Pachinko has a vast network of followers who are loyal to their cause. If we manage to convince them that the Goddess is testing our faith, they might be willing to help us in our fight against corruption. And who knows? We might even stand a chance at bringing some justice to this city.

I understand that this plan comes with its fair share of risks, but I believe the potential rewards outweigh them. Together, we can create a powerful alliance and make Arclight City a better place for all choombas.

Let me know what you think about this proposition. I'm willing to do whatever it takes to make our city safer and more just.

With hope,

Fifi
