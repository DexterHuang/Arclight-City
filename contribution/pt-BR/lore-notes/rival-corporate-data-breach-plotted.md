*You notice a computer screen lit up in the corner of the room.*

*On the screen, you see a chat window open with an unknown user named 'Lilith'. She seems to be communicating with someone about a recent job.*

Lilith: Hey man, did you hear about the latest job from Robert Smith? He wants us to take down that rival corporation again.

Unknown: Yeah, I heard about it. But aren't we supposed to stay neutral? That's what Lee Jong-suk said.

Lilith: Come on, we both know how these guys play. If we don't help each other, who will? Besides, it's just a simple data breach. Nothing too serious.

Unknown: Alright, alright. I guess you're right. When does the operation start?

Lilith: Tomorrow night. Meet me at the usual spot before midnight. Don't forget your new cyberwear from Wei Chang. It should make this easier than last time.

Unknown: Will do. See you then.

*With a smirk, Lilith signs off from the chat. You wonder what kind of trouble she's getting herself into.*
