To Whomever It May Concern:

My name is Jehanna Miller, and I am offering a substantial reward for anyone willing to track down and eliminate Robert Smith. You see, Mr. Smith has been embezzling funds from our charitable foundation for years now, using the money to line his own pockets while leaving us struggling to help those we promised aid to. Enough is enough – it’s time for him to face justice.

If you accept this contract, please contact me directly via encrypted email (details provided upon request). Your identity will remain anonymous until after completion of the task. Once again, thank you for considering taking on this mission. We truly appreciate your efforts in helping us restore balance within our organization.

Yours Sincerely,

Jehanna Miller
