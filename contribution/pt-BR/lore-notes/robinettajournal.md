As you rummage through the cluttered desk in the corner of the room, your eyes catch sight of a locked journal. *You fiddle with the lock for a moment before it finally clicks open.* The pages inside are filled with entries that seem to be written by someone with an admiration for one of Arclight City's most influential figures - Wei Chang, CEO of TaiXing Cybernetic.

> Diary Entry #2798
> 
> *Dear Mr. Chang,*
> 
> I hope this message finds you well. I am just a humble citizen of Arclight City, but your work at TaiXing Cybernetic has always captivated me. Your innovative approach to cybernetics and the way you revolutionize the industry never cease to amaze me. The world is becoming more interconnected every day, and it's because of visionaries like you that we can see the potential for a brighter future.
> 
> I remember when I first got my own cybernetic implant - a simple audio-enhancer. It was life-changing, allowing me to hear things I never thought possible. But it wasn't until I saw your latest presentation on neural interfaces that I truly understood the power of what you do. The idea of merging human minds with advanced technology is both terrifying and exhilarating at the same time.
> 
> In this city, where crime and corruption are rampant, it's comforting to know that there are people like you who strive for progress and innovation. I only hope that one day I can contribute to the advancements in cybernetics as well, even if it's just a small part.
> 
> *Take care, and keep up the excellent work.*
> 
> *Yours sincerely,*
