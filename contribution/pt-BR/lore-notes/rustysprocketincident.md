You notice a datapad lying on the floor amidst scattered gear and broken furniture. It seems untouched, its screen still flickering faintly. Curiosity piqued, you pick it up and swipe the unlock pattern – a crudely drawn skull with glowing red eyes. A voice recording starts playing, shaky and panicked.

***Kylynn Lopez: Choom… choom, I gotta get this down before… before it’s too late. It happened fast, like a glitch in the system. One minute we were chilling at The Rusty Sprocket, next thing you know, this guy… he just snapped.***

***Kylynn's voice cracks, a sob escaping her lips.***

***Kylynn: His eyes… they weren’t human anymore. All glowing neon green, like some kind of damn demon. He started screaming about code and glitches, then just went berserk. Chrome fists tearing through flesh, cybernetic limbs flailing like tentacles. It was… it was like watching a nightmare come to life.***

***The recording cuts abruptly, replaced by static. You hear a muffled scream, then silence. A chill crawls down your spine. You flip through the datapad's files, finding more fragmented recordings, each one capturing a different angle of the carnage. One shows Kylynn desperately trying to barricade herself in a bathroom stall, her voice choked with terror as she hears the cyberpsycho’s inhuman growls outside. Another shows a security camera feed, the grainy footage depicting bodies strewn across the bar, their cybernetics sparking and smoking.***

***Kylynn's final message, a desperate plea sent moments before the recording ends, reads: ***

>**Please… someone help… They’re everywhere… He’s infected them… We’re all gonna die.**

***You close the datapad, the weight of Kylynn's terror settling heavy in your gut. The stronghold is eerily quiet now, the only sound the hum of malfunctioning machinery and the distant wail of sirens.***
