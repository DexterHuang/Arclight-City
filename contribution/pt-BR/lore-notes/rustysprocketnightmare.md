> It happened so fast. One minute I was drowning my sorrows at the Rusty Sprocket, next minute… hell unleashed. The guy at the bar, looked like a chrome-plated nightmare with those glowing red eyes and that buzzsaw grafted to his arm. Started screaming about “digital demons” and how they were gonna "liberate us from the meat." Next thing I know, he’s ripping into some poor choomba who tried to intervene. Blood everywhere. Screams echoing off the grimy walls.

> I dove for cover under a table, adrenaline pumping like a jackhammer. Saw others trying to run, but it was hopeless. He moved like a goddamn phantom, blades whirring, cybernetic limbs tearing through flesh and bone. The air reeked of ozone and burnt flesh. It was a slaughterhouse. 

> I stayed huddled there for what felt like an eternity, praying the demons wouldn't find me. Finally, the screaming stopped. Silence, thick and heavy, settled over the bar.  Cautiously, I peeked out. The chrome-freak was gone, vanished like a ghost. Only carnage remained. Bodies strewn about, some still twitching, others… just still. 

> They say cyberpsychos are beyond help, lost to the digital abyss. But seeing this… it’s worse than that. It’s a goddamn nightmare made flesh. I don't know if I can ever forget the look in his eyes, the manic glee as he tore through those poor souls. 

> I need to get out of here.  Find somewhere safe. Somewhere the demons won't find me.
