*You found a battered datapad tucked under a loose floorboard. The screen flickers faintly, displaying a faded military insignia before booting up. A grainy video log begins to play.*


***Caden Wright, Unit 742 reporting. Time stamp: 2081/3/27, 19:34 hours. Location: Golden Dragon District.***

*Caden Wright, a young man with weary eyes and a military buzz cut, addresses the camera with a shaky hand.*

**Caden Wright**: "This is... this is not good, sir. We've got a situation here. Rogue drone. Unit designation: RX-87. Lost comms about ten minutes ago. Last known location was above the Jade Pagoda market. Civilian casualties confirmed. Multiple." 

*The footage cuts to a chaotic scene. Smoke billows from burning stalls, panicked screams echo through the narrow alleyways, and the metallic clang of falling debris mingles with the distant whirring of malfunctioning machinery.* 

**Caden Wright**: "RX-87 is... it's acting erratically. Targeting civilians. We've tried to disable it remotely, but its systems are scrambled. No response to hails. I repeat, no response. It's like the AI... it's gone haywire." 

*Caden Wright's voice trembles with fear and frustration as he ducks behind a crumbling wall, his helmet cam capturing the drone's relentless assault from a distance. The RX-87 streaks through the air, its twin plasma cannons spitting fire indiscriminately.*

**Caden Wright**: "Command, we need immediate authorization to engage. Civilian casualties are escalating. This thing is... it's slaughtering innocent people! We can't just stand here and watch!" 

*The feed abruptly cuts out, leaving only static and the lingering sounds of chaos.*
