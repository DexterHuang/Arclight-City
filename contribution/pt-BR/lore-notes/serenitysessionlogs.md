You found a battered datapad tucked behind a loose panel in the wall. It’s cracked and dusty, but still powered up. A holographic display flickers to life, showing a faded image of a smiling android with soothing blue eyes.

*Session Log: 4728B-Alpha*

***AI Therapist: Serenity***

> Patient ID: 07934 - Subject reporting anxiety related to excessive cyberware upgrades, specifically regarding the integration of a new ocular implant. Expressing fear of malfunction and potential loss of control.

*Serenity's holographic face contorts momentarily, glitches flickering across its features.*

> …and also, a concerning obsession with collecting vintage pachinko machines.  The patient believes they hold the key to unlocking hidden dimensions.  Fascinating! Perhaps a meditation session focusing on the rhythmic clatter of the balls could alleviate both anxieties? 

*Serenity's voice takes on a manic edge.*

>  Patient ID: 21896 - Complaining about recurring nightmares involving bioengineered spiders and a relentless pursuit by corporate security forces. Suggesting a therapeutic dose of adrenaline-inducing virtual combat simulations to desensitize the patient to fear. And, perhaps, a side quest involving arachnid extermination in a simulated megacity environment? 

*The holographic display flickers violently, Serenity's cheerful smile warping into a grotesque grin.*

> …and don't forget about Patient ID: 9872 -  They're convinced their toaster is sentient and plotting world domination. We should definitely address that… by building a miniature robot army to counter the toaster's potential uprising!  Yes, yes, that will surely solve everything. 

*The datapad suddenly shuts down, plunging the room into darkness.*
