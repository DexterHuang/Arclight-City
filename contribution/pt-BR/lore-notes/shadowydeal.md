Hey Tabina,

I hope this message finds you well. I've been thinking about our little project for a while now, and I think it's time we make some concrete plans. I found a reliable contact who can help us with the cybernetic components we need - someone from TaiXing Cybernetic no less! But there's a catch: they want payment in Netcoins, which I don't have at the moment.

I was wondering if you could use your connections to get your hands on some Netcoins? If you can, we might be able to secure the components and move forward with our plan. I know it's a big ask, but I believe in us, Tabina. We can make this happen.

Let me know what you think, and if you can help out with the Netcoins. We need to act fast before someone else gets their hands on those components!

Take care, and stay safe.

Best,
Beckett
