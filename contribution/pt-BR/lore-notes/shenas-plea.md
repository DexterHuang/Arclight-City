*You rummage through the cluttered desk in the dimly lit stronghold, amidst the scattered cyberware components and broken dreams, you stumble upon a worn-out datapad with a cracked screen. As you manage to boot it up, a video log appears on the screen, and you can't help but feel a pang of empathy.*

**Shena Lee's Plea**

*Shena Lee, a young woman with short, spiky black hair and piercing green eyes, sits in front of the camera, her voice shaking with desperation.*

**Shena Lee**: "Kael, it's me, Shena. I'm recording this in the hopes that you'll see it, that you'll finally listen to me. I know you're still out there, lost in that virtual world, but I need you to come back to us. To come back to me."

*She takes a deep breath, her eyes welling up with tears.*

**Shena Lee**: "Do you remember when we first met at the Red Bar? You were this charming, carefree merc, always with a smile on your face. We had so much fun together, exploring the city, taking on gigs... But then, you started getting deeper into the augmented reality scene. You said it was just for fun, for the thrill of it all, but I knew better. I knew you were running from something, from the pain of your past."

*Her voice cracks, and she pauses, collecting her thoughts.*

**Shena Lee**: "I tried to be supportive, I really did. But it's been months now, and you're gone. You're gone, Kael. You're lost in that virtual world, and I don't know how to reach you anymore. Your family is worried sick, your friends are starting to give up on you... And I'm left here, alone, wondering what I did wrong."

*She looks directly into the camera, her eyes pleading.*

**Shena Lee**: "Kael, please. For the love of everything we shared, please come back to me. Leave that virtual world behind and come back to the real one. We need you, I need you. You're not just a merc, you're my choom, my friend, my everything."

*The video log ends abruptly, leaving you with a sense of unease and concern for the fate of Kael and Shena.*
