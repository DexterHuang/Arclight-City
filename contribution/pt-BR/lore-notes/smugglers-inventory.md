> You stumbled upon an old terminal hidden behind a stack of crates in the corner of the room. As you approached it, you could see that someone had hastily scribbled down some notes on its screen. It looked like a list of items and quantities followed by names of contacts and destinations.
> After carefully examining the information, you realized that these were inventory lists from a smuggler's operation. The items listed included various types of contraband such as neuroblockers, stimulants, and hallucinogens. There were also entries for weapons and ammunition, including fully automatic rifles and grenade launchers.
> The routes mentioned in the documents seemed to cover several countries across Europe and Asia Pacific regions. The contacts section contained names and codes for different individuals involved in the operation, each responsible for specific aspects of the supply chain.
> As you continued going through the files stored on the computer system connected to this terminal, you began piecing together a picture of a well-organized criminal enterprise with connections spanning multiple continents. However, before you could gather more intel about their activities, alarms started blaring throughout the building signaling that reinforcements were coming.
> With barely any time left, you quickly copied down as much information as possible onto a data chip which would later prove invaluable when dealing with this particular faction operating within Arclight City's underbelly.
