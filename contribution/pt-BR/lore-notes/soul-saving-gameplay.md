The Church of Pachinko has uncovered the truth about CircuitBreak, the elusive security company that rules Arclight City with an iron fist. They are not just protectors of the wealthy and powerful - they are a front for something far more sinister. Their true goal? To harvest souls through their nefarious dealings in the underworld.

Don't fall prey to CircuitBreak's deception! The Church of Pachinko offers salvation from this corrupt organization. Join us and learn how to play the game of chance that could save your soul - or at least give you a fighting chance against those who would see you enslaved.

Remember, every time you pull the lever on a pachinko machine, it's not just for entertainment...it might be your ticket out of hell!
