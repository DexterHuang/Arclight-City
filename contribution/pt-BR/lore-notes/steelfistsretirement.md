*You found a battered datapad tucked inside a dusty locker, its screen flickering faintly. It's password-protected, but after a quick scan with your cyberdeck, you manage to bypass it. A holographic image flickers to life, revealing a weathered face framed by shaved chrome and glowing blue ocular implants.*

> *To my Choom, wherever this finds you,*

*The voice is raspy, laced with the metallic rasp of artificial vocal cords.*

> *They call me "Steel Fist" in the ring. Used to be a damn good name. Now it just feels like a cruel joke.  I'm hanging up the gloves, choomba. Time to trade these cybernetic fists for something... quieter.*

*The hologram flickers, showing close-ups of his scarred hands, wires snaking beneath the flesh. The implants in his eyes glow with an unsettling intensity.*

> *Years of bone-crunching brawls, of dodging laser fire and taking hits that would've shattered a normal man.  I pushed my body beyond its limits, embraced the chrome. But every punch, every block, it took a toll. My joints scream more than they move these days, and the neural implants... they buzz like angry wasps. I can barely sleep without dreaming of blood and steel.*

*A wry smile flickers across his face, but the eyes hold a haunted look.*

> *I've made my fortune in the ring, choom. Enough to buy myself a quiet life, maybe even a little patch of dirt somewhere away from the neon glare and the endless grind.  Maybe I'll learn to garden, or fix up old bikes. Anything but this... this endless cycle of violence.*

*The hologram fades, leaving behind only the faint hum of the datapad.*
