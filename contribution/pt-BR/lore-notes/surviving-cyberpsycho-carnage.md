> Dear Diary,
> Today was supposed to be just another day working at the local bar, serving drinks and making ends meet. But little did I know, it would turn out to be the worst nightmare of my life.
> As usual, I arrived early at the bar to prepare for the evening crowd. Suddenly, we heard gunshots outside. At first, we thought it was just another gang fight, something we had grown accustomed to living in this hellhole of a city.
> But then, chaos ensued. Men dressed in all black, faces hidden behind masks, burst into the bar firing indiscriminately. Panic set in as everyone tried to flee or hide. I remember crawling under the counter, praying that I wouldn't be discovered.
> It seemed like hours before the silence returned. When I finally mustered up the courage to peek out from my hiding spot, I saw bodies lying everywhere – bloodied corpses strewn across the floor like discarded dolls. My heart raced as I realized that these monsters weren't ordinary criminals; they were something else entirely – cyberpsychos.
> These twisted individuals moved with an almost mechanical precision, methodically searching each body for valuables or information. Their eyes gleamed with an eerie intensity, devoid of any empathy or remorse.
> Eventually, they left without finding whatever they were looking for. But their presence left us shaken to our core. We knew that we couldn't stay here anymore; this place had been tainted by their evil touch. So, we packed up what few belongings we could carry and fled into the night, hoping to never return to this cursed place again.
