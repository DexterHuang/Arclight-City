As you were looting the stronghold, you noticed a cyberdeck on a table, with a message open.

> I can't believe this is happening... I need to document everything so that others can learn from it. This is my survivor's testimony.

> It started as just another night in Arclight City. Marlena and Tarrah were with me, and we decided to hang out at the Red Bar before heading back home. We didn't know what awaited us that evening.
> 
> The bar was crowded, but we managed to snag a table near the back. As we sipped our drinks and laughed, I couldn't help but feel uneasy about something. It was like an itch I just couldn't scratch. I shrugged it off as paranoia and tried to enjoy the night.
> 
> Suddenly, the doors burst open, and a group of cyberpsychos stormed in. They were wearing all sorts of cyberwear and had their implants glowing menacingly. I could see the crazed look in their eyes - they were far beyond help at this point.
> 
> Chaos ensued as people scrambled to defend themselves or find a way out. Marlena and Tarrah were caught off guard, and before I knew it, they were dragged away by the cyberpsychos. I tried to fight back but was quickly overpowered.
> 
> The next thing I remember is waking up in an alleyway, battered and bruised. My heart sank as I realized Marlena and Tarrah were nowhere to be found. I knew then that they had likely become victims of the cyberpsycho massacre.
> 
> I reported the incident to the Arclight City Police Department (ACPD), but their response was lackluster at best. They seemed more interested in covering up the incident than actually doing something about it. It's no secret that they're in bed with the Mega Corporations, so I wasn't surprised by their inaction.
> 
> As for me, I'm now living in constant fear of another cyberpsycho attack. I try to stay vigilant and keep my cyberwear up-to-date, but it's a never-ending battle. If there's one thing I've learned from this experience, it's that Arclight City is a dangerous place where anyone can become a victim of the cyberpsychos lurking in the shadows.
