Hello Lilith,

I hope this finds you well. Just thought I should let you know about a recent encounter I had with a particularly troublesome customer. He seemed quite interested in your latest line of cyberwear, specifically the ones designed for close combat situations. However, during our transaction, he became increasingly aggressive and started making threats towards me. It got so bad that I had no choice but to call the authorities.

It would be great if you could keep an eye out for him and report any suspicious behavior. His name is Paul Edwards (or Kaye Nguyen), and he seems to be carrying around a lot of cash. If you see anyone fitting his description, please don't hesitate to contact me immediately.

Take care,
Maxine
