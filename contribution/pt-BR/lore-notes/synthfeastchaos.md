*You stumble upon a dusty server room, flickering lights casting long shadows across stacks of forgotten tech. A lone terminal hums quietly in the corner, its screen displaying a chaotic video feed.*

***Axel Sanchez, a gaunt man with greasy hair and nervous eyes, frantically adjusts his microphone.***

**Axel Sanchez:** "Welcome back, chooms, to the SynthFeast 2082! We're down to our final three contestants, ready to tackle the legendary 'Mystery Dish'! This year's prize is a sweet ride – a souped-up CyberRunner courtesy of TaiXing Cybernetics!"

***The camera pans to three figures hunched over steaming bowls. Their faces are obscured by close-ups, highlighting nervous bites and exaggerated chewing sounds.***

**Axel Sanchez:** "Remember, chooms, this dish is a culinary masterpiece crafted by the finest synth chefs in Arclight City! We've got rumors swirling about exotic spices, lab-grown proteins, and maybe even a dash of—"

***A sudden commotion erupts. One contestant, a burly woman with cybernetic implants glinting on her arms, slams her bowl down. Her voice cracks with fury.***

**Contestant 1:** "This ain't synth! This is…real food!"

***The other contestants gasp. Axel Sanchez stumbles over his words, desperately trying to regain control.***

**Axel Sanchez:** "Whoa, whoa, hold on a sec! What are you talkin' about? It's all—"

***Another contestant, a wiry young man, throws back his head and laughs hysterically.***

**Contestant 2:** "Real food?! In this godforsaken city? You gotta be kidding me!"

***He grabs a spoon and shoves a mouthful into his mouth. His eyes widen in disbelief.***

**Contestant 2:** "Holy chrome, it's…it's delicious! Sweet, juicy, tangy…"

***The camera shakes violently as the contestants erupt into chaos. Bowls are overturned, food splatters across the table, and shouts of disbelief and delight fill the air.***

***Axel Sanchez screams over the din, his voice breaking.***

**Axel Sanchez:** "Security! We got a situation here! It's…it's organic!"


***The feed cuts abruptly to static. The terminal emits a low whine, then falls silent.*
