> You entered a small room filled with dust and cobwebs. On the desk lay an old terminal covered in spider webs. As you brushed away the debris, you saw a flickering light indicating that someone had accessed the system recently. With a quick glance around, you typed in your credentials and waited for the interface to load.

> After several minutes of waiting, the screen finally lit up revealing a message left behind by a mysterious figure named 'Raven'. The message read:

> *Beware! Dangerous cargo heading towards the docks.*
> *Target: Unknown*
> *Description: A tall man wearing all black, carrying a briefcase containing sensitive information about our operations.*
> *Payment: €10,000 upon successful retrieval of the package*
> *Note: Be careful, he won't go down without a fight.*

> Raven seemed to know something about an impending threat at the docks involving a tall man dressed entirely in black. It appeared that this individual was armed and dangerous, making caution necessary during any confrontation. However, the potential reward of €10,000 could prove enticing for those willing to take on the risk.
