*The terminal boots up slowly, revealing a text editor window. You see a file named 'MyStory'. Curiosity gets the best of you, and open the file.*

Once upon a time, in the year 2076, I was just another kid living in Arclight City. My parents had moved us here years ago hoping for a better future. Like everyone else, we lived in the crowded slums near the heart of the city. Life wasn't easy, but we managed to scrape by selling whatever we could on the black market.

One day, while wandering around the streets looking for something interesting to sell, I stumbled across an abandoned warehouse filled with strange machines and equipment. It turned out that these machines were used for modifying humans – giving them enhanced abilities or replacing body parts with advanced cybernetics.

At first glance, it seemed like magic – the ability to fly or shoot laser beams from your eyes! But after learning more about it, I realized how dangerous this technology really was. Many people who went down this path ended up losing control of their minds or bodies completely – turning into violent psychos known as "cyberpsychos."

Despite the risks, I couldn't resist the temptation. I started experimenting on myself, installing various modules and implants until finally, one day, everything went wrong…

Now here I am, trapped inside my own head, unable to control my thoughts or actions. All I can do is watch as my once promising life spirals out of control. Maybe someday someone will find this journal and understand what happened to me… Or maybe I'll remain forever forgotten in this broken shell of a body.
