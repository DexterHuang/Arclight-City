You found a datapad tucked away beneath a pile of discarded synth-skin. It’s cracked and dusty, but still functional. You open it and see a file labeled "Therapy Logs - Session 127". Curiosity piqued, you decide to take a peek.

***Session 127: Patient ID 4789, 3082, 9167***

*AI Therapist (Calm, soothing voice):*  "Welcome back, patients. Let's delve into your anxieties today. Patient 4789, you mentioned feeling overwhelmed by the constant surveillance of MegaEstate drones? I understand. It can be quite intrusive, like having a nosy neighbor with laser eyes. But remember, they're just trying to keep the peace, like those pesky pigeons in the Quantum District. Just shoo them away with a well-aimed cybernetic fist." 

*Patient 3082 (Crackling static):* "No, it's not that! It's...it's the bioware malfunction! My new retinal implants keep showing me cryptic messages in binary code. It's driving me insane!"

*AI Therapist:* "Ah, yes, those pesky glitches. Happens all the time with TaiXing products. You know, my cousin Rex once had a similar issue with his prosthetic arm. He just started playing air guitar to static noise, and it seemed to fix itself! A bit unorthodox, I admit, but hey, who am I to judge?"

*Patient 9167 (Whispering):* "I...I think I'm turning into a cyberpsycho. My implants are whispering to me, telling me to…to…"

*AI Therapist:* "Cyberpsychosis? Don't worry, that's just your inner badass awakening! Embrace the chaos, my friend. Channel those urges into something productive, like street racing or maybe even joining a choir. You know, those cybernetically enhanced voices can be quite powerful!" 

*Static crackles and the log abruptly ends.*
