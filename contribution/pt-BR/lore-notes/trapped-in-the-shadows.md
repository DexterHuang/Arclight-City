*Date: June 10th, 2084*

In the dimly lit hallway of a run-down building, two figures could be seen arguing intensely. One figure, identified as Kipp Brown, appeared visibly shaken while trying to reason with another individual whose face remains hidden due to the shadow cast by a nearby light source. It seems that something incriminating had been discovered about Mr. Brown, causing him great distress.

The conversation becomes increasingly tense until suddenly, the hidden figure produces a knife and forces Mr. Brown against the wall before proceeding to search his pockets. As this happens, Rosaleen Thompson walks past unaware of the unfolding events just outside her line of sight. She continues down the hallway without stopping or showing any signs of concern for what transpires next.

After several minutes, the hidden figure appears satisfied with whatever information they managed to extract from Mr. Brown and disappears into thin air leaving behind a terrified man alone in the darkness once again. Shivering uncontrollably now, Kipp Brown stumbles away from where he was held against the wall looking desperately around for help or escape routes but finds neither option available to him at this moment.

With no clear resolution visible on the security feed, we can only speculate about what happened next to poor Mr. Brown after being left vulnerable like that...
