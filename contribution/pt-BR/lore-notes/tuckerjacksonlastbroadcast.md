You are rummaging through a dusty office, searching for anything valuable amidst the chaos. A faint hum emanates from a corner, drawing your attention to an old terminal tucked behind a toppled filing cabinet. The screen flickers erratically, displaying a distorted image of a gaunt man with haunted eyes.

> **Tucker Jackson here. This is my last broadcast. I know they're listening, watching, waiting to silence me. But I have to get this out there. What MegaEstate is doing… it’s not just corporate greed anymore. It’s something far worse.**

The image stutters, revealing a glimpse of a sterile white lab behind Tucker. The flickering light casts grotesque shadows across the walls. 

> **They call it "Project Genesis." A program to enhance low-income tenants with cybernetic implants, supposedly to improve their lives. But it's a lie. They're using them as test subjects, experimenting on vulnerable people without consent, pushing the limits of human augmentation without regard for the consequences.**

Tucker’s voice cracks, his gaze fixed on something unseen beyond the camera lens. 

> **I saw what they did to Maria. A single mother just trying to provide for her child. They implanted her with experimental neural circuitry, promised her a better life. Now she's… different. Violent. Uncontrollable. They call it "cyberpsychotic." I call it murder.**

The image flickers violently, Tucker’s face contorted in anguish. 

> **They'll try to discredit me, paint me as a paranoid lunatic. But the truth is out there. The evidence is buried deep within MegaEstate’s servers. If you can find it, if you can expose them… please do it for Maria. For all the victims trapped in their twisted experiment.**

The screen goes black. Static crackles through the speakers. Silence.
