*On the screen, a chat window pops up.*

Whisperer: Hey guys, just got word about a big job coming up. It seems like CircuitBreak wants to take down MegaEstate.

Anonymous1: That sounds interesting. Any idea how we could get involved?

Whisperer: Well, Lee Jong-suk himself reached out to me earlier today. He mentioned something about forming a new team for the operation.

Anonymous2: Wow, really? So what does he need us to do exactly?

Whisperer: Apparently, they need someone who knows their way around the city and its underbelly. Someone who can gather information and set things in motion without being detected.

Anonymous1: Sounds like our kind of job then. When do we start?

Whisperer: As soon as possible. Meet me at the usual spot tomorrow night. Bring your best gear and don't forget your netcoins. This is going to be a lucrative mission.
