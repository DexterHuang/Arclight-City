Dear Weiss,

I know we haven't talked in ages, but I had to reach out to someone about this. You remember our old days right? When we were just kids trying to make ends meet while dreaming about the big city? Well, now I'm here and it's nothing like I imagined. It's filthy, crowded, and dangerous. But don't worry, I've managed to land myself a job with The Whisperer. She introduced me to some interesting folks who seem to know how to survive around here.

But that's not why I'm writing. There's something else going on that feels wrong deep inside. One of my new contacts told me about these rich snobs living in luxury condos near the Celestial Gardens District. He says they never come out except for special occasions and they're protected by private armies. Sounds fishy right? That got me thinking maybe there's more than meets the eye with these guys. Maybe they're hiding something important or doing shady stuff behind closed doors.

Anyway, I need your help again buddy. Can you dig up some information about these wealthy types? See if there's anything suspicious going on or anyone worth talking to. And please keep this between us for now. I don't want to rock the boat until I'm sure about something.

Stay safe out there,

Lilith
