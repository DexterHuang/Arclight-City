*In a dimly lit bar near the edge of town, Paulie Nguyen and Wendye Flores sat at a table discussing recent events.*

> *Paulie gestures towards the screen showing news footage of a burning building.* That's crazy man, did you hear about what happened last night?

> *Wendye nods her head slowly, looking impressed.* Yeah, I heard he went ballistic after losing everything. Supposedly he had some kinda meltdown and started shooting everyone indiscriminately before torching the place himself.

> *Paulie whistles softly.* Now that's a legend right there. You know who we're talking about don't ya?

> *Wendye grins widely revealing a row of sharp teeth.* Of course I do! We all do... He's practically a myth at this point. But seriously though, how does someone become like him? Like completely detached from reality like that? It's almost like they crossed over into another dimension or something.

> *Paulie takes a sip from his drink before answering.* Well according to rumors floating around, it starts with installing too much cyberware and using stimulants nonstop until your brain fries itself. Then again, maybe it's just born outta pure rage and despair. Who knows? All I know is I wouldn't wanna end up like him â€“ chopped up into tiny pieces scattered across the city while my remains are sold off piecemeal on the black market.
