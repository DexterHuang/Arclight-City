Dear Mr. Smith,

This is your last chance to pay us what we want. We know how important your family is to you, and we won't hesitate to harm them if you don't comply. Our demands may seem steep, but remember, your safety (and theirs) is our top priority. You have until next Friday to transfer the funds to the account provided below. If we don't hear from you by then, we cannot guarantee their wellbeing.

Account Number: 9876543210
Bank Name: Europol Bank
Transaction ID: EDDIES-ABCDEFGHIJKLMNO

Do not involve the authorities or attempt any funny business. We are watching you closely.

Yours truly,

The Church of the Singularity
