As you were looting the stronghold, you noticed a cyberdeck on a table, with a message open.

> Hey Beckham, have you heard about V?

**Beckham King**
> Who's V?

**Tania Edwards**
> Oh, come on! The legendary mercenary who took down CircuitBreak's old headquarters with a tactical nuke. Single-handedly obliterated the whole place!

**Beckham King**
> No way! That's insane. Is it even true?

**Tania Edwards**
> It's definitely true. I heard they once infiltrated Steel Breaker's fortress and single-handedly took out an entire squad of full-borg mercs. Their cybernetic enhancements make them nearly unstoppable.

**Beckham King**
> That sounds like a story from the Church of Pachinko or something. Can you really trust someone who's that good?

**Tania Edwards**
> I don't know about trust, but V has earned their reputation. If anyone can handle dangerous gigs, it's them. You should be more worried about those cyberpsychos running around the city after getting too many implants.

**Beckham King**
> True, true. But still, I can't help but feel a bit envious of V's skills. They must have some really impressive cyberwear to pull off stuff like that.

**Tania Edwards**
> Yeah, probably TaiXing Cybernetic stuff or something even more advanced. Who knows what kind of tech they've got under their skin?

**Beckham King**
> Maybe one day we'll meet V in the Red Bar and get to ask them about their adventures ourselves. Until then, let's just focus on staying alive in this city, huh?

**Tania Edwards**
> Agreed. This place is full of crazies and danger at every corner. Let's stick together and try to make it through the night.
