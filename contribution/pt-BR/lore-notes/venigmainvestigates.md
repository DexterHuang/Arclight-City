You stumble upon a datapad lying open on a dusty desk, half-hidden beneath a pile of discarded weapons manuals. The screen flickers faintly, displaying a news report from a local Vtuber channel titled "Sunny Sparkles Investigates: The V Enigma." Hana's cheerful voice, albeit slightly distorted by static, fills the room as you activate the datapad.

***Jehanna White giggles nervously*** 
**Hana:** *Choomies! Sunny Sparkles here, back with another juicy piece of Arclight City gossip. Today we're diving deep into the shadowy world of high-stakes merc work, specifically, the mysterious exploits of a legend known only as "V." This ain't your average trigger-happy goon, folks. V operates on a whole other level, pulling off audacious heists, neutralizing high-profile targets, and vanishing without a trace. It's like they teleport from one gig to the next! 

***Hana leans closer to the camera, her eyes wide with excitement***
**Hana:** Now, folks, word on the street is that V ain't just any merc for hire. They seem to have a knack for picking gigs that ruffle some serious feathersâ€”think corporate espionage, dismantling rival gangs, even taking down rogue cyberpsychos. And they always get the job done, clean and efficient, leaving no loose ends. 

***A montage of grainy security footage plays, showing glimpses of shadowy figures in high-tech armor executing daring maneuvers.***
**Hana:**  We've got intel suggesting V might be working solo, but some choombas whisper about a crew operating under their command. Imagine that, a whole squad of elite mercenaries answering to one enigmatic leader! 

***Hana pauses, tapping her chin thoughtfully***
**Hana:** But here's the real head-scratcher: who's pulling V's strings? Is it a shadowy megacorp looking for an edge? A desperate noble seeking retribution? Or maybe even something more sinister lurking in the depths of Arclight City's underbelly? 

***The datapad flickers, the screen going dark before abruptly cutting to static.***
