*You notice a datapad lying on a dusty workbench, its screen flickering faintly. It’s clearly been used recently, judging by the smudges of grime and fingerprints on its surface. You swipe it open, revealing a news report from “Arclight City News Network.” The headline screams in bold, neon-pink letters:*

**V: Ghost in the Machine - Another High-Profile Hit Raises Questions**

---

*The datapad’s screen flickers to life, displaying Hana’s familiar, bubbly face, her pink and blue hair bouncing as she speaks.*

***“Hey there, Choombas! Sunny Sparkles here, bringing you the latest buzz from Arclight City. We’ve got a real head-scratcher this time - another high-profile hit, and it’s all pointing to one shadowy figure: V!”***

*The screen cuts to grainy footage of a recent corporate heist, masked figures moving with deadly precision. A voiceover drones on about stolen tech and vanished security personnel.*

***“Now, V isn’t exactly new to the scene. Whispers have been circulating for months about this legendary mercenary, someone who operates in the shadows, taking on jobs that would make even the bravest choomba sweat. But this latest hit? It’s got everyone talking.”***

*Hana leans closer to the camera, her voice dropping to a conspiratorial whisper.*

***“Word on the street is V doesn’t work for just anyone. They’re selective, taking only the most lucrative and dangerous gigs. And who could afford such a high-caliber mercenary? My sources are pointing fingers at some big players - maybe CircuitBreak looking to eliminate competition, or even MegaEstate wanting to silence a troublesome whistleblower?”***

*The screen shifts again, displaying a montage of security feeds showing V’s signature moves: lightning-fast reflexes, uncanny accuracy with cybernetic weaponry, and an almost supernatural ability to vanish without a trace.*

***“Whatever the reason, one thing’s for sure: V is playing a dangerous game. And whoever’s pulling their strings… well, let’s just say they’re not afraid to get their hands dirty.”***

*The datapad flickers once more, then goes dark. Hana’s parting words echo in your mind: “Stay tuned, choombas. This story is far from over.”***
