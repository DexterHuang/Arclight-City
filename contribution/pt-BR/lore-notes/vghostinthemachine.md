**Sunny Sparkles Vlog - Arclight City News**

*Hey chooms! Sunny Sparkles here, bringing you the latest buzz from the streets. Today’s topic? The enigmatic mercenary known only as “V.” This ain’t your average trigger-happy merc, folks. V operates in a league of their own.*

*We’re talking ghost-like disappearances after high-stakes gigs, whispers of impossible feats of cyberwarfare, and contracts so hush-hush they make even CircuitBreak blush. Just last week, word on the street was V single-handedly neutralized an entire squad of TaiXing security bots guarding a BioSyn shipment - clean and silent, like they weren’t even there.*

*Now, who’s bankrolling this phantom? Speculation runs rampant. Some say it’s MegaEstate, trying to muscle out competition in the black market cyberware trade. Others whisper about Trauma Team, using V to eliminate inconvenient witnesses. Even the Church of the Singularity has been thrown into the mix, with theories about V being a test subject for their AI ascension program.*

*Whatever the truth, one thing’s for sure: V is changing the game. They’re a force to be reckoned with, and the city’s elite better watch their backs. Until next time, chooms, stay safe out there! And remember, if you see a shadow flit across your vision, it might just be V.*
