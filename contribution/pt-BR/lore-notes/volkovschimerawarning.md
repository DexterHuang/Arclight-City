You stumble upon a dusty old terminal tucked away in a corner, its screen flickering faintly.  A half-eaten energy bar lies beside it, suggesting someone was interrupted mid-transmission. You decide to check it out, hoping for some intel on this gang's operations.

> **Last Transmission - Project Chimera** 
> *Initiating Emergency Broadcast Protocol* 
> **This is Dr. Anya Volkov, lead geneticist at BioSyn Industries. I am broadcasting this message knowing full well it may be my last.** For years, I've worked on groundbreaking projects, pushing the boundaries of human potential. But what we've been doing under the guise of "enhancing" humanity...it's monstrous. 
>  
> **Project Chimera**, that's what they call it. It involves forcibly implanting experimental bioware into unwilling subjects â€“ mostly orphans and refugees, snatched from the streets. They claim it's for "the greater good," to create a superior workforce. But these are human beings, not lab rats! 
>  
> I saw the results firsthand. The implants twisted their bodies, warped their minds. Many died in agonizing pain, others became hollow shells, driven mad by the invasive technology. My pleas to stop it were ignored. They silenced dissent, threatened my family...but I can't stay silent any longer.
>  
> **To anyone who hears this, please believe me. BioSyn is committing atrocities. They are playing God, and they are destroying lives.** Spread the word. Expose them. I may be silenced, but my conscience demands that someone knows the truth. 
>  
> **This is Dr. Anya Volkov, signing off. May justice prevail.**
