You notice a datapad lying open on a dusty table amidst scattered ramen containers and empty energy drink cans. It’s clearly been used recently, the screen still faintly glowing. Curiosity piqued, you pick it up and see a hastily-typed message titled “VR Date Disaster - NEVER AGAIN!” 

---

> So, I thought I'd give this new VR dating app a shot, right? Figured I could snag some sweet loot from those corporate shills who think they can buy love with their Eddies.  Name’s Jax, by the way, and I'm a damn good hacker, even if my social skills are about as smooth as a rusty servo. Anyway, I matched with this chick named "CyberSiren," sounded hot, had a killer avatar – all chrome and neon, like something outta TaiXing's latest catalogue. 

> We set up our first date in this fancy virtual restaurant, supposed to be all high-end ambiance, but the second we logged in, things went south faster than a choomba on payday. First, my avatar started doing this weird jig, like it had a glitch in its locomotion module. I tried to play it cool, blamed it on lag, but CyberSiren just stared at me with these deadpan eyes and said, "Is that your default dance move?" 

> Then, things got REALLY weird. My digital face started melting, literally dripping pixels like a cheap hologram. I panicked, tried to log out, but the damn system froze. Meanwhile, CyberSiren's avatar decided to spontaneously combust into a shower of sparks and binary code. It was like watching a fireworks display gone wrong in a server room. 

> I managed to escape the virtual inferno just as my real-world headset started smoking. Lesson learned: stick to hacking for love, not dating apps.  At least when I crash a corporate server, there's no chance of embarrassing myself with a melting face.
