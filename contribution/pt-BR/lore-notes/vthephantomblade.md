*You notice a datapad lying open on a dusty desk, its screen flickering faintly. It appears to be a news report from Hana; Sunny Sparkles, titled "V - The Phantom Blade."  The audio is still playing, barely audible over the hum of the ventilation system.*


***Sunny Sparkles' cheerful voice fills the air***

> *Choomz! Welcome back to Sunny Sparkles News! Today's hot topic? The legendary mercenary known only as "V"! This enigmatic blade-for-hire has been popping up all over Arclight City, leaving a trail of bewildered goons and crumpled corporate contracts in their wake. 

> We've got reports from the Electroverse District, where V single-handedly dismantled a CircuitBreak security detail guarding some high-profile tech. Then there was that daring raid on MegaEstate headquarters, where they liberated a whole shipment of stolen cyberware destined for the black market. Talk about a righteous choom! 

> But who is this mysterious V? Some whisper they're a former Trauma Team medic turned vigilante, seeking justice for victims of corporate greed. Others claim they're a rogue TaiXing engineer, disgruntled with their employer's shady dealings.  Personally, I think V might be a cyberpsychos gone good! Imagine, a brain-fried badass with a heart of gold? Now that's a story I wanna see! 

> One thing's for sure, chooms, whoever's behind the mask of V is making waves. And the big question on everyone's mind: who's paying this phantom blade to pull off these audacious stunts? My sources say V operates on a strictly "no questions asked" basis, but even the most secretive mercenary needs a client. Could it be one of the city's mega-corps, playing their own shadowy game? Or maybe a powerful figure operating from the shadows, pulling the strings behind the scenes?

> Keep your eyes peeled, chooms, because V's next move could shake Arclight City to its core! This is Sunny Sparkles, signing off. Stay sparkly!*
