> Dear Easton,

> My heart aches every day without you. I never thought our love would end this way. When we met in that rundown bar, I knew you were different from anyone else. Your smile could light up the whole room, and your laughter filled me with joy. We shared dreams of leaving this hellhole behind us, finding somewhere peaceful where we could start fresh. But fate had other plans for us.
>
> As I sit here alone, surrounded by ruins and memories of happier times, I can't help but wonder what could have been. Would we still be together if we hadn't gotten mixed up with that gang? If we hadn't tried to steal from CircuitBreak? So many questions run through my head, but no answers seem forthcoming. All I know is that my love for you remains stronger than ever before.
>
> I wish I could turn back time, take back everything that happened, and start again with you by my side. Until then, please remember how much you mean to me. Know that wherever you are, whatever you're doing, my heart will always belong to you.
>
> Yours forever,
>
> Legra Lewis
