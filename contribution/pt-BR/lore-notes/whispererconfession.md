Title: The Whisperer's Confession

---
*You stumbled upon a hidden room within the enemy stronghold. In the dim light, you see a small desk with a locked journal on it.*

`>With trembling hands, you unlock the journal and start reading...`

*The Whisperer:*

Today was the day I finally realized my mistake. I've been playing both sides of this game for too long, and it's caught up with me. The Red Bar used to be a safe haven for mercs like us, but now it feels like a ticking time bomb. I can't keep living like this, always looking over my shoulder, wondering who's next on the hit list.

I remember when Jack Jackson came to me, desperate to expose CircuitBreak's dirty secrets. He had no idea what he was getting himself into, and now look at him - a target for every merc in Arclight City. I should have seen it coming; I should have warned him. But instead, I let my greed get the better of me, and now an innocent man is paying the price.

I can't save Jack from this fate, but maybe I can make things right with Ainslie Thomas. She was just a random person caught in the crossfire, but her death has haunted me ever since. If only I had been more careful, if only I hadn't pushed my luck so far...

From now on, I'm done playing games. I'll help Jack any way I can, even if it means turning my back on the Red Bar and all the connections that come with it. It's time to make amends and find some semblance of redemption in this cold, cruel city.
