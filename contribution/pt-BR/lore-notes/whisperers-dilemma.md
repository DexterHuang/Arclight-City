Audio Log - Whisperer's Dilemma
==============================

**Background noise: Footsteps approaching the Red Bar. Door opens and closes.**

---

**Chloe:** (Voiceover) "Listen up, folks. This is Chloe speaking."

*Sounds of clinking glasses and hushed conversations.*

**Chloe:** (Voiceover) "I know it's not my usual business to get involved in your gigs or crews, but I've got a problem that needs solving. The Whisperer - you know her, right? She's been acting strange lately."

*Sounds of someone taking a deep breath.*

**Chloe:** (Voiceover) "She's always been mysterious, but now she seems... off. Like something's weighing heavily on her mind. And I can't shake the feeling that it has to do with one of you."

*Sounds of a glass being set down with a thud.*

**Chloe:** (Voiceover) "I don't know what it is, but I want to help her. If any of you have information about what's been going on with her lately, or if you think you might be involved in whatever's got her so stressed, now's the time to speak up."

*Sounds of a chair scraping across the floor.*

**Chloe:** (Voiceover) "I know trust is hard to come by around here, but I swear on my life that anything you tell me will stay between us. Just think about it and let me know if you've got something to share."

*Sounds of the Red Bar slowly fading into silence.*
