*You stumble upon a hidden compartment within a desk, revealing a battered data pad. Its screen flickers faintly, displaying a scrambled message. You recognize the telltale signs of advanced encryption – this is no ordinary note.*

> **From:** Wraith
> **To:** Anyone who can hear this…
> 
>  **Encrypted: Level 5 – Quantum Key Required**
>
> I’m trapped. They call me Wraith in the Net, but here… I’m just another pawn. The Crimson Serpents have me cornered. They snatched my sister, said she'd be "re-educated" if I didn't play their game. 
> 
> They want me to breach TaiXing Cybernetics, steal their latest prototype – the Ghost Protocol implant. It’s a weaponized neural interface, capable of mind control on a massive scale. Imagine what they could do with it…
> 
> I can't let them get away with this. But I can't fight them alone. If anyone out there has the skills to crack this encryption, please… help me. Find my sister, stop the Serpents, and bring down their operation.  
> 
> There’s a hidden file on this pad – a partial blueprint of their hideout. It's risky, but it might give you a starting point. Don't trust anyone, especially not the Serpents' "assets" they send your way. They're double agents, all of them. 
> 
> I’m running out of time. My sister's life hangs in the balance. Please… someone, answer my call.
