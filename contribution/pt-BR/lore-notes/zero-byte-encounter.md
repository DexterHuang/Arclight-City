*You stumbled upon an old security camera system in this abandoned warehouse. As you hacked into the terminal to view the footage, you discovered it was from three days ago.*

> *Footage starts with a grainy image of the darkened warehouse, gradually improving as the cameras adjust to the low light conditions.*
> 
> **Narrator**: "This is security footage from Arclight City's warehouse district. The date is June 14th, 2082."
> 
> *The scene shifts to a dimly lit corner of the warehouse where Zero Byte, their face obscured by shadows and a stylish cybernetic mask, was furiously hacking away at an old terminal. A pile of data chips lay scattered around them.*
> 
> **Zero Byte**: "Almost there... just a few more minutes."
> 
> *Suddenly, the warehouse doors burst open, flooding the space with light. A group of mercenaries from CircuitBreak stormed in, their cybernetic enhancements glowing ominously.*
> 
> **CircuitBreak Mercenary**: "Hands where we can see 'em! We've been tracking you for weeks!"
> 
> *Zero Byte hesitated for a moment before slowly raising their hands. Their fingers still danced across the keyboard, inputting commands with lightning-fast precision.*
> 
> **Zero Byte**: "I suggest you back off. You don't want to be involved in this."
> 
> *Ignoring the warning, the mercenaries advanced on Zero Byte. Just as they were about to reach them, a sudden surge of energy filled the air, knocking the attackers off their feet.*
> 
> **Narrator**: "Unknown assailants have entered the warehouse and engaged in combat with CircuitBreak's forces."
> 
> *The footage shows Belle Garcia, a seemingly ordinary citizen, stepping out of the shadows. She held an advanced energy rifle, its power source pulsing with neon hues.*
> 
> **Belle Garcia**: "You shouldn't have come here, Zero."
> 
> *Zero Byte managed a weak smile before slamming their fist on the keyboard. A blinding flash of light enveloped them as they disappeared in a puff of smoke.*
> 
> **Narrator**: "The target has successfully evaded capture, and our team has been neutralized."
> 
> *As the mercenaries struggled to regain their footing, Belle Garcia turned her energy rifle towards them. The screen goes black as a deafening explosion fills the air.*
> 
> **Narrator**: "End of footage."
> 
> *You close the terminal, feeling a mixture of intrigue and unease at what you've just witnessed. Who was Belle Garcia? And why did she risk her life to protect Zero Byte?*
