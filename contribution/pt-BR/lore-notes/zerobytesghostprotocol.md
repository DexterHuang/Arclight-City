> Choom, I'm trapped. They've got me good. This ain't no gig anymore, it's straight-up slavery. The Razorbacks think they can control my code, twist my talents for their dirty work. But I ain't no puppet.

>  They're pushing me to breach TaiXing's firewalls, steal blueprints for their latest cybernetic implants. They want to sell them on the black market, make a killing off vulnerable choom. I can't let that happen. Not without consequence.

> I've been feeding them scraps, planting false leads, slowing them down every way I can. But they're getting wise. Soon, they'll realize I'm not playing ball. They'll crack my defenses, force me to do their bidding.

>  I need a way out. Someone with the skills and guts to pull me from this mess. Someone who understands the risks, the stakes involved. If you're reading this, you might be that someone.

> Here's what I can offer: intel on Razorback operations, access to their secure networks, blueprints for their latest cyberware modifications (the ones they think are top secret).  Enough to make a choom rich, powerful... maybe even dangerous enough to take them down. 

> But it'll take more than just data. It'll take action. A clean extraction, a ghost protocol operation. Get me out of this cage before they break me. Meet me at the usual spot, Midnight rendezvous, Sector 7. Bring your best gear, choom. We might need it.

> Stay frosty,
