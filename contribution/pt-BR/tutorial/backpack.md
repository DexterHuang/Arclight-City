## What is a Backpack?
The backpack is what you carry with you into strongholds. You can only access items in your backpack while in strongholds and items you pickup in strongholds will be stored in your backpack until you leave the stronghold. 
However, please be aware that if you die within a stronghold, the items in your backpack will be transferred to the Ripperdoc as a deposit to cover your medical expenses. You have the option to repurchase these items from the clinic if you so choose.
