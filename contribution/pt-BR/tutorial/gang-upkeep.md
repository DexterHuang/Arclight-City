## What is gang upkeep?
Gang upkeep is a fee that all gangs must pay every 7 days to keep functioning. If a gang doesn't have enough funding or resources to pay the upkeep fee, it will fall apart. That's why it's important to always keep the resources and funding topped up. We recommend keeping more than enough resources in stock just to be safe.

## How is the required upkeep resource calculated?
The upkeep fee is calculated based on the level of your gang and the number of members in it. The higher the level of your gang and the more members you have, the more upkeep resources you'll need.

## How can I increase resources for my gang?
You or your gang members can perform the `Gang Maintenance` AFK task for your gang. This task requires a gang maintenance resource crate, which can be obtained from strongholds, quests, or purchased from NPCs.

## How can I increase funding for my gang?
You or your gang members can click on the `Deposit` button in the gang details page to transfer money into the gang account.
