### What is Hideout Raid?

Hideout Raid is a feature that enables quick, small instant raids on gang hideouts. These raids necessitate either a `Hideout Locator` or an `Advanced Hideout Locator`.

### How do I perform a Hideout Raid?

To initiate a Hideout Raid, click on the `Hideout Raid` button found on the stronghold selection page.

### Are there any requirements to perform a Hideout Raid?

Yes, there are prerequisites for conducting a Hideout Raid. You must have cleared a Hard Difficulty Stronghold with a level that is at least 2 levels higher than your character's level. This requirement is implemented to prevent players from solely leveling up through hideout raiding.

### How do I clear strongholds higher than my character's level?

By default you can access strongholds equal to your character level, however you can access strongholds of higher level by clearing the hard difficulty stronghold a level below it. For example, if you are level 10, you can access strongholds of level 10 by default, however you can access strongholds of level 11 if you cleared the level 10 hard difficulty stronghold.

### What are the rewards for Hideout Raids?

Hideout Raids yield rewards such as experience points (exp) and eurodollars, alongside other bonuses. The amount of exp and eurodollars you receive scales in proportion to the enemies present in the stronghold at your character's level. The `Advanced Hideout Locator` offers superior rewards compared to the regular `Hideout Locator`.
