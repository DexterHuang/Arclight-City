## What is Inventory?
Every adventurer has their own inventory, which can be used to store items and loot. Items stored in the inventory will not be lost when you die in strongholds.


## How do I increase inventory size?
You can increase the number of slots in your inventory by following these methods:
- Renting an apartment; higher-tier apartments come with a greater number of slots.
- Upgrading your inventory by clicking the `+` button located next to the slot counter.
