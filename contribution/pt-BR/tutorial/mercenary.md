## What are Mercenaries?
Mercenaries are unique units available from the Red Bar that you can recruit to join your crew. Each mercenary has distinct stats and a special ability for use in PvE combat. When you add a mercenary to your crew, their stats are added to your own, and you can use their ability when it's off cooldown. Think of them as special combat items with unique abilities.

## How to Obtain More Mercenaries
You can recruit more mercenaries using your "Red Bar VIP Tokens" through two methods:
- **Recruit One:** Spend 1 token to get a random mercenary.
- **Recruit Ten:** Spend 10 tokens to get 10 random mercenaries, with a guaranteed chance of receiving at least one 4-star or higher mercenary.

## Upgrading Your Mercenaries
To upgrade your mercenaries, go to the mercenary's details page and click the upgrade button. This process consumes a specific amount of "Cybernetic Enhancers", "Neural Upgrade Augmenters" and Eurodollars depending on the mercenary's level.

## Obtaining Cybernetic Enhancers or Neural Upgrade Augmenters
You can acquire these items through various means:
- **Dismissal:** Dismiss your mercenaries to receive Cybernetic Enhancers or Neural Upgrade Augmenters based on their level and rarity. Dismissing higher-star-rated mercenaries is an effective way to obtain more Neural Upgrade Augmenters quickly.
- **Looting:** Obtain them from strongholds, AFK tasks, daily rewards, and daily quests.
- **Purchase:** You can directly purchase them from the premium shop.

## Improving Mercenary Abilities
If you find your mercenary's ability to be weak, consider:
- **Upgrading:** Increase your mercenary's level to enhance their abilities.
- **Understanding Abilities:** Carefully read the mercenary's ability description. Some abilities are multi-targeted or damage-over-time based, which may seem weaker initially. However, they can be more effective in certain situations. For example, a mercenary with a multi-heal ability might heal less per target than one with a single-target healing ability. Still, in combat with multiple players, the multi-heal benefits can surpass the single-target healing ability. The same principle applies to multi-targeted damage abilities.
