## What is cyberpsychosis?
Psychosis is a mental disorder characterized by a disconnection from reality. usually caused miss-using or overusing of cybernetic implants. at severe cases, it can cause the patient to become violent and attack anyone around them. therefor all legal implants are required to have a cyberpsychosis limit, which ensures that the user cannot overuse the implant. if the user reaches the limit, the implant will shut down and the user will be unable to use it until the limit is reset by either resting or using a cyberpsychosis stabilizer, such as `NeuroBlocker`.
