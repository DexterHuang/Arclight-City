## What are territories?
Territories in Arclight City refer to each district of the city. Gangs can compete to gain control over a territory, and the controlling gang will have their banner displayed in that district. Additionally, they will enjoy various buffs in that district.

## How to take control over a territory?
To take control over a territory, go to the territory page and click the `Territory Control` AFK task. This requires the `Gang Control Resource` item, which you can obtain from strongholds, quests, and other means. Each time you or your member completes the AFK task, your gang's control point increases. Whichever gang has the highest points will be the controlling gang in that district!
